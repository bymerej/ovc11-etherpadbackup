Y U NO HAVE NOTES?
(/me starts notes late)

attempt to fill in from earlier:

(Introduction: mix of lawyers, filmmakers, students, activists in room)

discussion revolving currently around a system similar to RECAP that grabs videos taken down with a DMCA notice and either: makes available to others who also have the extension, spawns a repost bomb via other people who have the extension reposting to their own accounts

DMCA: used for copyright infringement takedowns, requires notice sender to swear that they have a legit claim, but often false claims go unpunished. Court precedent suggests that you must see if it is a fair use before sending the takedown;in practice this rarely happens. 

DMCA often used in place of other kinds of takedown requests such as for political and protest material, even when main issue is not copyright, because it is an easy and fast process.

 * Larger question: if we're working our way from a Youtube takedown application to a robolawyer in general... it's supposed to be based on judgment, e.g. contextual relevance. 
 * It doesn't automatically repost it for you, it just sets things up for you to approve reposting?
 * ... someone sitting in their basement could say "I think this is fair use" but have no idea. There ought to be some sort of community discussion, no?
 * There are hundreds and thousands of videos taken down every day that are just reposting of TV shows...
   * It's not going to scale to every single takedown
   * Not just click a box perhaps, there are the "best practices for fair use" and stuff where you don't need a lawyer.
 * Bring more robots into this process! Screen out blatant infringement, e.g. whole copies of M*A*S*H
 * Let people state what part of a video is their copyrighted portion?
   * if it's 10 seconds out of a 3 minute video, I can say "well, that sounds like fair use to me"
   * most of these takedowns are done by humans who press the button after they are screened by bots
 * A part of the problem with automation is that many of these questions come down to judgment... but isn't judgment like taste? Can't taste be automated through e.g. Pandora? [or spam filters / Gmail's important e-mail filter]
 * Fair use clairvoyance: find "experts" whose taste is measured to be consistent with what is actually fair use! :D
 * No one understands fair use (including my parents!)
   * fair use is lawyer employment :P
