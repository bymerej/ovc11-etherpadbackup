(Introduction: mix of lawyers, filmmakers, students, activists in room)

discussion revolving currently around a system similar to RECAP that grabs videos taken down with a DMCA notice and either: makes available to others who also have the extension, spawns a repost bomb via other people who have the extension reposting to their own accounts)

 * Larger question: if we're working our way from a Youtube takedown application to a robolawyer in general... it's supposed to be based on judgment, e.g. contextual relevance. 
 * It doesn't automatically repost it for you, it just sets things up for you to approve reposting?
 * ... someone sitting in their basement could say "I think this is fair use" but have no idea. There ought to be some sort of community discussion, no?
 * There are hundreds and thousands of videos taken down every day that are just reposting of TV shows...
   * It's not going to scale to every single takedown
   * Not just click a box perhaps, there are the "best practices for fair use" and stuff where you don't need a lawyer.
 * Bring more robots into this process! Screen out bla
