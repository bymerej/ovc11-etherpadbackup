 * Larger question: if we're working our way from a Youtube takedown application to a robolawyer in general... it's supposed to be based on judgment, e.g. contextual relevance. 
 * It doesn't automatically repost it for you, it just sets things up for you to approve reposting?
 * ... someone sitting in their basement could say "I think this is fair use" but have no idea. There ought to be some sort of community discussion, no?
 * There are hundreds and thousands of videos taken down every day that are just reposting of TV shows...
   * It's not going to scale to every single takedown
