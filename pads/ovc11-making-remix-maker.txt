Objectives

1) An HTML5 version of the gendered ads Audio/Video Swapper
-ideally, this tool should allow people to download their remixes and post them elsewhere online.
-we'd like to get the code onto github

2) A github-like forking platform that lets end users access and build future variations of the Audio/Video swapper and other remixer applications (we mentioned datacouch.com) 

3) A new variation of the Audio/Video Swapper that lets people swap the intro songs between television shows.

4) Getting started on building entirely new video remixer applications. Here's the potential projects that came up so far:
- Removing the voiceover track from movie trailers but keeping the music (with fletcher munsen curves? We would need someone who knows sound.)
- Rewriting the titles for advertisements or the subtitles for movies by using an interface that lets you just type them in (example: type your own Hitler Downfall Parody)
- Sculpting alternate versions of people's speeches by clicking through a menu that lets you mishmash their sentences (see "Rumsfeld Rules http://bit.ly/mYXQtl)
- A "VJ-O-Matic" tool that uses prematched beats and melodies to let people easily drag-and-drop a VJ mix (We would need a musician VJ or DJ to help us pick the tracks)
- An automatic lip-syncer that collects every possible syllable-shape that a mouth can make so you can lipsync anything you want 
  (see some of the "read my lips" videos http://bit.ly/qK9z68 -- we would have to do research on the different syllable formations)



Session Prpoper:

- Projects that could do something with video gameplay footage?
- Education
- Cultural
-

"ideas" group:
- education emerges as a key interest 

- problem with using YouTube in restrictive school situations
    > what about adding text to videos
        - difference between invideo text/ subtitles and overlay (like YouTube annotations) 
        -  reemergence of "VH1 Pop-Up Video"/ what about the relevance of this?
    > sentence remixing 
        - the configurable formulas made modular

- Prescription drug commercials
    > using Cathy Davidson's research in Now You See It: How the Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work and Learn
    > what about deconstructing the formula of prescription drug commercials
    
- http://books.google.com/books?id=vcgbNxO5BosC&printsec=frontcover&dq=now+you+see+it&hl=en&ei=xIhrTqDmDsKIrAe40eHSBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q&f=false

- Examples brought up:

- Return to the application of the technology 
    > The breaking up
    > The Conversation
    
Breakdown the conventions
    > tagline / side effects 
    
Is it necessary to have

    > Place for commentary
    > Deconstruct a piece to bring to the surface these issues
    
Commenting the timeline. Attaching commentary to the particular moments...(like SoundCloud)

Overview: 
    > group of pharmaceutical commercials
    > analyze this group    
        - find the conventions 
    > separate all the elements
    > make elements modular
    > then you can bring those all together and swap them with other advertisement genres
    
    > also the helpful part of logging these conventions
    
    > Elisa had mentioned the importance of transcription, not only of dialogue

Ex. Wikiclips 
    > dynamic taxonomies
    > designing tools that keeps with dynamic taxonomies
    
For use in the classroom:
    > Would be best to have it flexible enough to accommodate the conversation that happens there, what if another trope is noted in the classroom? And then we can start pulling that trope out 'on the fly' in the classroom.
    

Making tags flexible  
- how to deal with 1000s of clips
- dealing with a large archive to retrieve smaller clips

Challenge:
- How do you log the clip? (and make that easier for the user?) 
- How this gets logged, we need to design the system for this. 
    > this would determine how you would tag
> what about tagging / then cropping and preserving context

Tagging might become a bigger issue later on when it becomes crowd-sourced

Expectations for Monday: 
- Not really an interface
- One example / one pharmaceutical workshop prepared

- what happens to the whole of the timeline in this splicing

> Remixes / content is important

Summary: 

- Nice to haves:
    > click through interface that breaks down the pharmaceutical commercial by menu 
        - choose every element
