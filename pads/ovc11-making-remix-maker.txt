Objectives

1) An HTML5 version of the gendered ads Audio/Video Swapper
-ideally, this tool should allow people to download their remixes and post them elsewhere online.
-we'd like to get the code onto github

2) A github-like forking platform that lets end users access and build future variations of the Audio/Video swapper and other remixer applications (we mentioned datacouch.com) 

3) A new variation of the Audio/Video Swapper that lets people swap the intro songs between television shows.

4) Getting started on building entirely new video remixer applications. Here's the potential projects that came up so far:
- Removing the voiceover track from movie trailers but keeping the music (with fletcher munsen curves? We would need someone who knows sound.)
- Rewriting the titles for advertisements or the subtitles for movies by using an interface that lets you just type them in (example: type your own Hitler Downfall Parody)
- Sculpting alternate versions of people's speeches by clicking through a menu that lets you mishmash their sentences (see "Rumsfeld Rules http://bit.ly/mYXQtl)
- A "VJ-O-Matic" tool that uses prematched beats and melodies to let people easily drag-and-drop a VJ mix (We would need a musician VJ or DJ to help us pick the tracks)
- An automatic lip-syncer that collects every possible syllable-shape that a mouth can make so you can lipsync anything you want 
  (see some of the "read my lips" videos http://bit.ly/qK9z68 -- we would have to do research on the different syllable formations)



Session Prpoper:

- Projects that could do something with video gameplay footage?
- Education
- Cultural

"ideas" group:
- education emerges as a key interest 

- problem with using YouTube in restrictive school situations
    > what about adding text to videos
        - difference between invideo text/ subtitles and overlay (like YouTube annotations) 
        -  reemergence of "VH1 Pop-Up Video"/ what about the relevance of this?
    > sentence remixing 
        - the configurable formulas made modular

- Prescription drug commercials
    > using Cathy Davidson's research in Now You See It: How the Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work and Learn
    > what about deconstructing the formula of prescription drug commercials
