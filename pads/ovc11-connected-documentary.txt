30 Mosques, 30 States, 30 days
http://30mosques.com/ || 30 Mosques in 30 States is Aman Ali and Bassam Tariq’s Ramadan road trip across the United States.

Started as a blog which got attention. They took filmmakers onboard for the project. Using technologies to engage with the audience. For example, used Livescribe pen for blog entries http://www.livescribe.com/fr/. 

Showing video segment from the project http://vimeo.com/28186883  "Freeway spits a few verses inside an Indian grocery store during a segment we like to call “Saffron Cipher”"

Film about the blog, meta documentary on the process of the making the blog and the personal journey of it's creators. Opportunities to integrate all of the content around this project, the photos, the blog entries, the vlog entries and the video documentary of the process. They are looking to create a web experience. Sharing some of the ideas they have, showing a mockup of a non-linear narrative including other people doing a 30 Mosque process. 

----------------------------------
Question / comments (notes might be more sketchy...)
----------------------------------

Q1 - How to make the story relevant to larger communities?
Q1 - What would drive engagement ?

Q2 - Participant wants to know more about the mockup they show, which is a map with videos blobs layered onto it. 

Q3 - Question about narrative focus, what is the story ?
The challenge would be to find interesting people. Finding more people who are willing to share their story, experiences. 

Are multiple entry point in a narrative relevant and efficient ? 

Q5 - How to show Muslim experience in different places around the world?
    what kinds of interfaces would you design to facilitate this?
    
Q6 - holding live events, building communities
They did some live events on the road. 

Q7 - Archiving issues
- Storify as an example http://storify.com/
- Tools which might be relevant : 
http://constellation.tv

Q8 - How to integrate the content in a relevant web experience ?
- Consistent metadata. Cataloging, archiving and retrieving. For example http://pbcore.org/ whatever tool, the important part is consistency.
- The Association of Moving Image Archivist http://amianet.org  might be of interested to contribute for this kind of data structuration. Posting a message to their list-serv could be a good way to get in touch with them.

Q9 - What about another organizing structure alternative to the map. What about using the 30 days of Ramadan as the organizing structure? The map neutralizes the content, this (calendar/ temporality) could bring all threads together

Q10 - Release strategy for the feature documentary.
- Possibilities to integrate web elements in the film frame.

The Tillman Story
Amir Bar-lev || http://www.tillmanstory.com/

First a feature documentary 
(From Wikipidea : The film is about the 2004 death of U.S. Army Ranger Pat Tillman in the war in Afghanistan, the cover-up of the true circumstances of his death, and his family's struggle to unearth the truth. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tillman_Story )

Creating a interactive version of the film
The ending of the movie tends to engage people to act. The audience asked how to engage. That's why they decided to create an interactive edition of the feature film. 

The movie's based on a huge amount of archives with a lot of scribbling in the margins. Filmmaker tried to recreate this experience of margin annotation.

The feature films plays in the center of the frame and is surrounded by a group of widgets. The widgets break down in four categories. Updates, outtakes, documents and forums

Updates. Allows to show updated information about the subject

Outtakes. Filmmaking is building a story and sheer away everything that does not fit in the story. In the end you have a lot of good material on "the cutting room floor". Especially for this film, some of the most inciendary information was not included in the final cut. 

Documents. The ability to visualize the 350 (and more) pages of document the film is based on.

Forums. Live chats and annotations in the documents.


----------------------------------
Question / comments
----------------------------------
Amir also gived a pitch of this project at another event. http://www.tribecafilminstitute.org/filmmakers/newmedia/news/125824118.html

C1 - This might be an opportunity to reinforce the subject matter. The big part of the story is the source documents. Popcornjs as a tool to get those documents out with the video content. Making the documents annotable, link the data with the film through popcorn. 

C2 - Difficulty to create non-linear content. Linear content might still be essential to branch off in the non-linear content. Worries that things can get hijack, content overload. 

C3 - Film as a starting point to create connections between different events. 

Is film out on DVD?

Way around rights issues: use QR codes; use audio fingerprinting

Opening website up for commentary?
    Could be very radical; lose authorial control
    Amir is a little nervous about this(?)

Generativity--
    Torah / talmudic commentary interface makes a lot of sense
    Marginalia is fitting for the story
    
Militaristic people might engage online, though they might not elsewhere

Ethan McCourt: soldier rescued a kid (from Wikileaks? follow up)

Gotta edit out the cruft_the stuff that's unacceptable

Document cloud  - http://www.documentcloud.org/home
OCR, content annotation. Working on keeping annotation from being "just an inline commenting system" actively working on guidelines for interaction, moderation

guardian took all parliament MP expense reports, revelead malfeasance thru crowdsourcing. "does this look real?"

Need a team to make this work, coders, designers, citizen journalists.

Opportunity : bringing the audience in, allowing them to act.

    - at each city for about a week 
    - ends with big event / topop entries voted for
    
Photographs gathered through this reflect the diversity of the Black community

Engagements between cities through the website/ Community engagement through these uses of social media 

Blanket participation through multiple social media outlets/ websites: flickr, facebook, vimeo

Gathering Resources through Digital Diaspora store - http://ddfr.tv/store/

trans4mations
    - making an archive interactive to engage and educate a younger/ broader audience with different historical scenarios
    
Needs: 
    - technical aspects of gaming 
    - creating a model that can take the project to different cities 
    - figuring out a systeme to integrate videos and photos in realtime during live events
    - activating communities that attend screenings of the film 
    
Demographic for digital diaspora mostly women ranging in age 40s-70s

BM: This project is similar to a traditional transmedia case  

----------------------------------
Question / comments
----------------------------------
    
Q: What about reaching out to marketing interests? 
(Or maybe collaborate with designers more)

From a designer's perspective:
How do these pieces fit together to the larger project/ towards building a larger entity "is this movie a helvetica kind of movie?"    

Q: the photograph is key for this project, and now might be diluted / lost in the diversity of the digital diaspora project. 

Q: what's the Content Management System for this project?
A: Have been using Filemaker internally/ We're seeking advice for metadata as the project continues and begins to connect to other archives / documents/ media. Looking for online applications to accommodate this. 

Q: There should be a way to handle all the assets that you're collecting into an information architecture. Although it can sound intimidating, it's as simple as how do you log the information that you're collecting. 

can use visual recognition, genealogy, etc?
A lot of issues come up with this question/ some of these topics will be more fully explored in the Oral History Best Practices working group tomorrow

C: Bringing up funding and the way some broadcasters think even today of online content ancillary. Even the model of distribution (home video) not there anymore// public television completely changed from that previous model.

C2: Between different models now... and there are different projects that are really rethinking what the form of documentary on the web is

C3: Budget determines what the projects can looks like

C4: From NEA perspective, looking for projects that will move the funders forward. "this is where we are, let's move forward from here"

C5: Brings up issue of crowdfunding 

C6: 1) Seems there should be an archivist on the team, should have project number and media asset numbers. 2) Aesthetic, photos are coming from scrapbooks / scrapbook as holder of history/ family of a place / family of a time / could make for an interesting interface 
Response: That's a thread in the film... 
so it connects.

Haven't actually had funding for a designer / have had funding for the roadshows

To address difficulty of having funding meet project needs
C7: Requires getting creative within the rules. 

"the broccoli of the film world"
but I reject that label, it's not outreach, it's art. "we are not broccoli"

Question / comments
----------------------------------

Q: Plugin ready or collaborating with developers?
A: Wanting to use popcorn, will need developers for that/ the project design will now be changing after the grant. 

Q: Have you seen East 7th Street?
A: Yes. Lots of examples in this genre... 
link: http://7thstreetmovie.com/

Q: Glad to bring up the issue of access. interesting to bring it offline. 
A: We're doing some small-scale events // push in the neighborhood to rebrand it as "Los Sures," it's a loaded term. 

Q: The original film, is Diego very permissive?
A: We just now about UnionDocs collaboration with it. UnionDocs has license, not really 'remix' more annotation. 

A: "participatory segments" gangs turned into biking communities / oral history of these aesthetics / others not as participatory / 

Q: What are you struggling with in the project?
A: Different ways to interact with the community.. more models for participatory content. What are the main conflictss in the neighborhood currently and how they connect to the 1984 documentary. 

Q: Launch?
A: Diego is visiting October 15th... there will be an event then. 

C: Release early and release often. And if you're not embarrassed, you didn't release it early enough.
