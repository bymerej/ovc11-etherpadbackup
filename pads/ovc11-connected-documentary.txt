30 Mosques, 30 States, 30 days
http://30mosques.com/ || 30 Mosques in 30 States is Aman Ali and Bassam Tariq’s Ramadan road trip across the United States.

Started as a blog which got attention. They took filmmakers onboard for the project. Using technologies to engage with the audience. For example, used Livescribe pen for blog entries http://www.livescribe.com/fr/. 

Showing video segment from the project http://vimeo.com/28186883  "Freeway spits a few verses inside an Indian grocery store during a segment we like to call “Saffron Cipher”"

Film about the blog, meta documentary on the process of the making the blog and the personal journey of it's creators. Opportunities to integrate all of the content around this project, the photos, the blog entries, the vlog entries and the video documentary of the process. They are looking to create a web experience. Sharing some of the ideas they have, showing a mockup of a non-linear narrative including other people doing a 30 Mosque process. 

-----------------

**Question / comments time (notes might be more sketchy...)
Q1 - How to make the story relevant to larger communities?
Q1 - What would drive engagement ?

Q2 - Participant wants to know more about the mockup they show, which is a map with videos blobs layered onto it. 

Q3 - Question about narrative focus, what is the story ?
The challenge would be to find interesting people. Finding more people who are willing to share their story, experiences. 

Are multiple entry point in a narrative relevant and efficient ? 

Q5 - How to show Muslim experience in different places around the world?
    what kinds of interfaces would you design to facilitate this?
    
Q6 - holding live events, building communities
They did some live events on the road. 

Q7 - Archiving issues
- Storify as an example http://storify.com/
- Tools which might be relevant : 
http://constellation.tv

Q8 - How to integrate the content in a relevant web experience ?
- Consistent metadata. Cataloging, archiving and retrieving. For example http://pbcore.org/ whatever tool, the important part is consistency.
- The Association of Moving Image Archivist http://amianet.org  might be of interested to contribute for this kind of data structuration. Posting a message to their list-serv could be a good way to get in touch with them.

Q9 - What about another organizing structure alternative to the map. What about using the 30 days of Ramadan as the organizing structure? The map neutralizes the content, this (calendar/ temporality) could bring all threads together

Q10 - Release strategy for the feature documentary.
- Possibilities to integrate web elements in the film frame.

The Tillman Story
Amir Bar-lev || http://www.tillmanstory.com/

First a feature documentary 
(From Wikipidea : The film is about the 2004 death of U.S. Army Ranger Pat Tillman in the war in Afghanistan, the cover-up of the true circumstances of his death, and his family's struggle to unearth the truth. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tillman_Story )

Creating a interactive version of the film
The ending of the movie tends to engage people to act. The audience asked how to engage. That's why they decided to create an interactive edition of the feature film. 

The movie's based on a huge amount of archives with a lot of scribbling in the margins. Filmmaker tried to recreate this experience of margin annotation.

The feature films plays in the center of the frame and is surrounded by a group of widgets. The widgets break down in four categories. Updates, outtakes, documents and forums

Updates. Allows to show updated information about the subject

Outtakes. Filmmaking is building a story and sheer away everything that does not fit in the story. In the end you have a lot of good material on "the cutting room floor". Especially for this film, some of the most inciendary information was not included in the final cut. 

Documents.
