/>Solution to Jay's problem of coins stored on boxen (e.g. phones) where the coin owner doesn't have root: store your coins on your freedombox. run your bitcoin client on your freedombox. run an app (maybe a webapp) on the freedombox that allows something on another box to manipulate some coins. (maybe with rate limits)<br

/><br
/><br
/><b>Use cases for alternative currencies and compensation</b><br

/><br
/><br
/>Exercise<br
/>Compensation models on open online creation. Things that should happen? Directions that we can go in. It could be a catch phrase like : I'm part of an organization that has a music player how can we make money out of this. Or I'm a youtube content creator. Reflect in directions that this type of work can go in...<br
/><br
/><b>What are the dream scenarios or use cases for donations and micropayments?</b><br
/><br
/><b>What needs to exist?&nbsp; What needs to get better?</b><br
/><br
/>Break into groups: 3 ppl per group.&nbsp; Here's what groups came up with:<br
/><br
/>[paste your notes here when done]<br
/><br
/>Monetizing the web<br
/><br
/>Cover charge vs. Tipjar<br
/><br
/>Paywalls might be a failure, while tipjar seems better?<br
/><br
/>Other ways to monetize the web: everything is a service, give away the content.<br
/><br
/>Build commuinity access to community, sell an acess fee for the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/><br
/><b>Bitcoin, what's standing in the way of mass adoption of Bitcoin? #1 security #2 liquidity (ease of buying, aka as easy as buying coffee) #3 currency risk</b><br
/><br
/>Super Group Nr 1<br
/><br
/><b>- How to flattr a youtube video? Should the uploader get the flattr or the original content author?</b><br
/><br
/><b>But&nbsp; how do remixers get paid directly?&nbsp; If they're just an intermediary,&nbsp; how do they get compensated.&nbsp; If they're creators how do we weight the&nbsp; value?</b><br
/><br
/>- How to finance music artists? Donations + concert tickets?<br
/><br
/>The big problem is make people pay. The only way is either creating a exchange culture, without expecting a reward inmediately.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>That's the reason behind flattr. To provoke this change to happen.&nbsp;<br
/>Kickstarter model is much more effective for these reasons.&nbsp;<br
/>Is the kickstarter model, could we implemented in other ways? Its an unsustainable model (kickstarter).&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;Its hard to count on people on donation. Doesn't mean that it will be the way of getting the most amount.&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>W<br
/>&nbsp;It get to a interesting paradox, social&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;the audience creates for free and watch for free. that's working well. Flattr makes it interesting. Where as the other model is not compatible with the phenomenon.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/><b>Virtual Goods and psychology of donations</b><br
/><br
/>A gradation of financial participation (you get more access based on a larger contribution)<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>why people think that virtual goods are valuable?&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;Curious in virtual goods role?&nbsp; How to marry the behavior between virtual goods and quality creative goods?&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;People pay for "stupid stuff" :) online just for fun!&nbsp; So why don't they pay for content.<br
/><br
/>Kickstarter has been really successful with the prizes.<br
/><br
/>Add game mechanics or points to Flattr, or other donation systems.<br
/><br
/>If the creator could know and customize their site for somebody who had donated.&nbsp; (But that's a kind of paywall)<br
/><br
/>It's okay to have different levels of return from the creator, it's positive, not necessarily negative the way a paywall might be<br
/><br
/>Flattr is like busking(sp?) which we see in NYC all the time.&nbsp; Talking to folks who live off that and learning about how it functions might be a good approach.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Maybe we're thinking too narrowly about it, could be donations of resources (studio space)<br
/><br
/>Farmville duck sales vs. washington post print edition sales?<br
/><br
/><b>Ease of use</b><br
/><br
/>Micropayments should be clickable (ease). I need to set up, it should be easier than that.<br
/><br
/><br
/><br
/>I believe that Flattr hacks that economic system that we work right now, by creating a model that it could be applied to any currency, either trade system as well as real currency (even bitcoins). Rather than standarizing another currency that sins for its same flaws.<br
/><br
/><br
/>- How to finance movie makers? Donations + movie tickets.<br
/><br
/>- Donations, paywalls, ads, is there a 4th way to make a living? Communism? ;)<br
/><br
/>Introduction to flattr - video<br
/><br
/>- It would be great to have flattr accept bitcoin.&nbsp;<br
/>Everyone in flattr has their own opinion. We don't accept bitcoin because of the legal implications.<br
/><br
/><b>(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻</b> Group<br
/>- how to get people use to any type of micropayment system? donation driven in particular.<br
/><br
/>it's gotta be easy.<br
/><br
/>the social part of kickstartr is you know what you're getting, there's the prize.&nbsp; that's like the virtual good that you pay for.&nbsp; This is a big key.<br
/><br
/>Donations were really important to an open source project with a huge server.&nbsp; When they made their bandwidth use and costs transparent, people would always donate enough to ensure survival.&nbsp; Transparency is key.<br
/><br
/>Like a feature request list.<br
/><br
/>Users know what they're paying for and know what they're getting.<br
/><br
/><br
/>- Bitcoin usibility? bitcoin only perks to create liquidity.<br
/><br
/>Example: stuff/services you can only buy/use with bitcoin<br
/><br
/>- Bitcoin's second generation software to improve UI/Ux.<br
/><br
/>Bitcoin development community really focusing on usability now.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>- a method to obtain Bitcoin without mining or buying with USD.<br
/><br
/>And if you can buy the things you need with bitcoin, there's less currency risk.<br
/><br
/>How do you make it possible for anybody to get access to Bitcoin.&nbsp; The focus has been on people who already are users, but it should be on everyone who isn't already a user.<br

/><br
/>Solutions that supports the artist.<br
/><br
/>Audience paying to contribute to (they might pay more if they could participate)<br
/><br
/>Proceeds needs to match what it costs to make the work.<br
/><br
/>Sponsors need to have to pony up more money.<br
/><br
/>Over throw iTunes and cut out the middle man.<br
/><br
/>A shift in culture, encourage people to want to pay.&nbsp; Through flattr, directly, however.<br
/><br
/>A ecosystem of creation and consuming that works in harmony. (create an experience in which money exchanges hands)<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br

/><br
/>####<br
/><i>Small Group</i> (Joe, Eric, Dennis)<br
/>Not a lot of existing experience with this because this is our first encounter with Bitcoin—so difficult to find the problem areas—so we expanded discussion to a best world scenario that will allow as many stakeholders to make money as possible.<br
/>We began by stating right up front that in developing online currencies, we should avoid replicating the conditions that have perpetuated economic inequality.&nbsp; Will people have the ability to save and invest new currencies, and what kinds of constraints on developing a new currency can we expect from regulators and from the global economic scenario.<br
/>Corporate: How do corporations engage with it?&nbsp; It seems to make sense for individuals.&nbsp; But how does it make sense for corporations.<br
/><u>Best-Case Scenario</u><br
/>Started from the premise that it be based on an economic philosophy that would facilitate internet transaction and incentivize investment.<br
/>Then discussed how to facilitate that:<br
/>So discussed some of the constraints as far as both the legal regulatory hurdles that would be involved, and compatibility with existing models.<br
/>We were particularly concerned with the likelihood that people would manipulate currency and take advantage.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>We ended discussing not just exchange currency, but also currencies that determine the value of content to advertisers.&nbsp; Things like radio and television ratings.&nbsp; We discussed whether compensation models should move away from the sampling method of determining audience size, to a one-to-one relationship between viewers and the advertisers.<br
/>For example, we discussed the possibility of&nbsp;&nbsp; world in which artists would be paid directly for their content, thus removing the need for an intermediary platform such as Pandora or YouTube.&nbsp; But we ran into a barrier, when we tried to understand how remixers of content would get paid under this model.&nbsp; In this framework, should remixers be considered intermediaries, or creators.&nbsp; If they are considered intermediaries, what incentive would they have to remix content.&nbsp; If they are considered creators, how do we weigh the value of their art against the value of the underlying works?<br
/>But despite these ideas, we still had an&nbsp; overall concern with incumbents—whether they are traditional television networks, multichannel video providers… or the treasury--locking down the Internet or preventing innovation in the development of new online currencies that are deemed to have gone too far.&nbsp;<br
/>Overall, it’s going to take a lot longer than 3 hours to address every issue that comes up.&nbsp; But we see this as a starting point, and look forward to keeping up the dialogue.<br
/>####<br
/><br
/>How can we do new currency on the web?<br
/><br
/>Whatever it is, it has to be widespread<br
/><br
/>Standardizing one currency needs some kind of central authority<br
/><br
/>The way your business model works depends on whether you already have a community or whether you're just starting<br
/><br
/>User never gets pissed off with the donation model.&nbsp; They pay for what they want.&nbsp; That gives the user a lot of respect.&nbsp; (users can get pissed off at a monthly fee if they don't use it / don't like it)<br
