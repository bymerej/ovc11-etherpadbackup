[photobooth mozilla labs demo]

permissions dialog

browsers agree on single means to get access to camera/mic, preferably as a media stream object

permissions
settings (how do they persist)
how to map devices to tabs
js api/html5 
two devices from same page (time synch)

permissions
===========
tying to domain is not sufficient.
should a site be able to force the browser to reprompt for permission to access device
session based

master swich a-la gps control in android

want to separate camera setup dialogs

need to be able to faking camera and mic

where should api live? under navigator object? already bloated.

enumeration
===========
can ask for permission for both camera and screen at the same time, not twice
only after user has consented
delegation of responsibility for picking devices can be delegated to the browser

use cases
=========
take a picture from camera
  hints [mandatory/preferable]
output to canvas/webgl
time lapse
record/review/upload
