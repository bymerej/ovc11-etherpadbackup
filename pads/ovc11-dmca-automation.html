<body>Y U NO HAVE NOTES?<br
/>(/me starts notes late)<br
/><br
/>attempt to fill in from earlier:<br
/><br
/>(Introduction: mix of lawyers, filmmakers, students, activists in room)<br
/><br
/>discussion revolving currently around a system similar to RECAP that grabs videos taken down with a DMCA notice and either: makes available to others who also have the extension, spawns a repost bomb via other people who have the extension reposting to their own accounts<br
/><br
/>DMCA: used for copyright infringement takedowns, requires notice sender to swear that they have a legit claim, but often false claims go unpunished. Court precedent suggests that you must see if it is a fair use before sending the takedown;in practice this rarely happens.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>DMCA often used in place of other kinds of takedown requests such as for political and protest material, even when main issue is not copyright, because it is an easy and fast process.<br
/><br
/><ul><li>Larger question: if we're working our way from a Youtube takedown application to a robolawyer in general... it's supposed to be based on judgment, e.g. contextual relevance.&nbsp;</li
><li>It doesn't automatically repost it for you, it just sets things up for you to approve reposting?</li
><li>... someone sitting in their basement could say "I think this is fair use" but have no idea. There ought to be some sort of community discussion, no?</li
><li>There are hundreds and thousands of videos taken down every day that are just reposting of TV shows...<ul><li>It's not going to scale to every single takedown</li
><li>Not just click a box perhaps, there are the "best practices for fair use" and stuff where you don't need a lawyer.</li></ul
></li
><li>Bring more robots into this process! Screen out blatant infringement, e.g. whole copies of M*A*S*H</li
><li>Let people state what part of a video is their copyrighted portion?<ul><li>if it's 10 seconds out of a 3 minute video, I can say "well, that sounds like fair use to me"</li
><li>most of these takedowns are done by humans who press the button after they are screened by bots</li></ul
></li
><li>A part of the problem with automation is that many of these questions come down to judgment... but isn't judgment like taste? Can't taste be automated through e.g. Pandora? [or spam filters / Gmail's important e-mail filter]</li
><li>Fair use clairvoyance: find "experts" whose taste is measured to be consistent with what is actually fair use! :D</li
><li>No one understands fair use (including my parents!)<ul><li>fair use is lawyer employment :P</li></ul
></li
><li>So there are a lot of people who say fair use is vague, but I think that is actually not true, and the best practices coming out of the Center for Social Media are disproving that. There are judges and lawyers who dislike fair use, but... If you look at the empirical studies, fair use has been gaining ground. ... Best practices tend to do it by community.<ul><li>it's really dangerous to say that fair use is always a crapshoot</li
><li>it's not giving enough credit to work that has been done to clarify it</li
><li>Best practices are wonderful for helping lawyers make decisions...</li></ul
></li
><li>It seems messed up that there are bots doing DMCA takedowns and then humans have to respond... all the burden is on the [users?]. How can we deal with that in a broader sense?<ul><li>So it is illegal for bots to send takedown notices now? but you think this is still going on?</li
><li>When Congress passed this law they meant to give a huge advantage to corporations, and we've been pushing back on that. Most of these humans who push the "takedown" button when given it by the bot... their jobs aren't risked if they screw up, right?</li
><li>There are no consequences for a frivolous takedown, right? Well, theoretically you can sue them, that's the Lenz case. But it would be nice to balance it out better.</li
><li>But if you had evidence that bots were sending takedowns, I would love to take on that case!</li></ul
></li
><li>Rich Jones has been making a website called Forktube during the conference - not live yet<ul><li>Post it!!!</li
><li>Forktube takes videos from other people on YouTube and moves a copy to your account, so you don't have to worry about them disappearing from the internet.</li
><li>"It's really simple and dumbass, but..."</li
><li>Have it be like those old games with tips like "Did you know that X jumps??" ... say "Did you know that translation is fair use??"</li></ul
></li
><li>"Also, is your laptop case a plastic bag?" "Shut up!"</li
><li>"Talking about whether this stuff is going to happen is a waste of time, because in most cases, I'm already doing it"</li
><li>"I am trying to destroy the legal system."</li
><li>The law is basically a huge shitpile, and they try to fix it by putting more crap on top. In programming we have this thing called refactoring... you never do that with the law. "It's like Microsoft Office!"</li
><li>OK, there is a mission creep problem in the law (everything always ends up containing an e-mail client) but there are in fact refactorings...<ul><li>What I think you're talking about which I completely agree with is, who does the refactoring in law?</li
><li>In open source movements... I mean, M$ Office is still there, and there is a grand tradition of piling crap on top of crap</li
><li>we have huge barriers to entry to becoming a lawyer, power, race, hierarchy, $, etc.</li
><li>what do you do about that, can you have an open/free movement? That's part of the conversation</li
><li>law students do some of the best casework!</li
><li>if you mess with the law, there could be ramifications for 3rd parties</li
><li>I'm not against you on that, I just worry about civil disobedience and completely routing around</li></ul

><li>Robolobbyists!</li
><li>It would be nice if some of the content platforms were convinced to release this data as a public service... strengthen their status as safe harbors? Help people make their fair use choices? Let<ul><li><br/><br/><br
