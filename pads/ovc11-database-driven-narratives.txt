Korsakow is not:
- a video-editor
- a video transcoder
- a motion graphic application
- a religion
- bulletproof (yet)

What is a SNU?

SNU (snoo) - smallest narrative unit
SNUs are the building blocks
The main task in korsakow is to SNUify
SNUifying involves keywording your time-based media assets. 

Origin of the name "Korsakow"...
Having to do with the content of Florian's thesis, on alcoholism in Germany. Results in... loss of short-term memory, a compulsion to tell stories.

Basic Workflow: 

Browser (online or local)
Interface (default)
Startscreen (static)
Preloader

File formats

Michael Niggel maps out "Journey Under the Sea"

A Korsakow film is different than the choose-your-own-adventure model 
- discouraging mapping out before
- think of it as a cloud "you're entering into a cloud"

A Korsakow film
A collection of connected SNUs

terms come from
University of Arts in Berlin professor

example - lithuanian students working on 
student filmmakers asked "what's the story?"

who is the main protagonist? 
how does he struggle?
who's the bad guy?
who's the good guy?
what's the moral?

what if you have a strong curiosme (sp?), but no story

we try to understand the world in stories... but what if that's only 2%

it is very things that are people are just good and bad 
things just right and wrong

"please join us in our mission to not have missions anymore"

Editor (desktop) > scale, transcode  --->> XML/ Video/ Audio/ Images ---> Player (web-based)

Korsakow Editor 
1) Written in Java
2) a lot of help from QT, FFMpeg, LAME
3) A little help from Applescript, Bat (missed some here)

Korsakow Player
1) Written in AS
2) A lot of help from JS
3) A little help from jQuery, SWFAddress, SWFObject, Flex

QUESTIONS:

- What if someone submitted code that we weren't sure about?
- Considering making a transition to HTML5
- In terms of scope:
- sidestepping transcoding 
- Perceptions: is Korsakow like iMovie? If I were a serious maker, why would I use it?
- Korsakow is dynamic, database storytelling - so it's not suited to something like Flash? 

Q: Questions about how keywods work ...     
A: Keywords can be thematic, they can formal, it is up to the author

MS C: But we're looking to move into the next generation of the keywords... 

Depending on how you use the keywords, you can have a lot of control... but do you want all that control?

Q: How does the community work this system out?
A: When I screen the films, audience members have laser pointers and choose the next SNU. Korsakow show ... with live experts.

Q: What about drama? 
A: Fragments is one example of this...  / It has been mostly been used for documentary, but I think it would work well for a new form of storytelling. 

C: It's an open question: Is documentary leading in non-linear storytelling?
There is an example that I didn't show - Switches/ Maybe documentary is more open to multiple narrative arcs. Not completely let go of authorial control, but begin to... 

Q: Could Day in Life have been a Korsakow project... // wasn't it really crowd-sourced .. 

Q: Are lives are linear, because time moves linearly. 
A: FT - I think we think this is the way our lives work this way because our narratives move linearly. 
MS - Life is more fundamentally nonlinear than it is linear. 

Q/C: What do you have to say about Memento, Pulp Fiction

C: Art!

Q: Does linear and non-linear have to be mutually exclusive?

Q: They aren't mutually exclusive and sometimes viewers are in different modes/ moods at different times... 

Q: Have you put this in front of a group of game developers?

A: No
