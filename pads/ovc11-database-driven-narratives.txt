What is a SNU?

SNU (snoo) - smallest narrative unit
SNUs are the building blocks
The main task in korsakow is to SNUify
SNUifying involves keywording your time-based media assets. 

Origin of the name "Korsakow"...
Having to do with the content of Florian's thesis, on alcoholism in Germany. Results in... loss of short-term memory, a compulsion to tell stories.

Basic Workflow: 

Browser (online or local)
Interface (default)
Startscreen (static)
Preloader

File formats

Michael Niggel maps out "Journey Under the Sea"

A Korsakow film is different than the choose-your-own-adventure model 
- discouraging mapping out before
- think of it as a cloud "you're entering into a cloud"

A Korsakow film
A collection of connected SNUs

terms come from
University of Arts in Berlin professor

example - lithuanian students working on 
student filmmakers asked "what's the story?"

who is the main protagonist? 
how does he struggle?
who's the bad guy?
who's the good guy?
what's the moral?

what if you have a strong curiosme (sp?), but no story

we try to understand the world in stories... but what if that's only 2%

it is very things that are people are just good and bad 
things just right and wrong

"please join us in our mission to not have missions anymore"
