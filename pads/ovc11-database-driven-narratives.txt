What is a SNU?

SNU (snoo) - smallest narrative unit
SNUs are the building blocks
The main task in korsakow is to SNUify
SNUifying involves keywording your time-based media assets. 

Origin of the name "Korsakow"...
Having to do with the content of Florian's thesis, on alcoholism in Germany. Results in... loss of short-term memory, a compulsion to tell stories.

Basic Workflow: 

Browser (online or local)
Interface (default)
Startscreen (static)
Preloader

File formats

Michael Niggel maps out "Journey Under the Sea"

A Korsakow film is different than the choose-your-own-adventure model 
- discouraging mapping out before
- think of it as a cloud "you're entering into a cloud"
