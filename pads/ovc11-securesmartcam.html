>=====================================<br
/><b><u>INTRODUCTION&nbsp;</u></b><br
/>=====================================<br
/><br
/><br
/><b>SecureSmartCam:</b> Nathan explains progress on the SecureSmartCam project.<br
/><br
/>See this blog post explaining progress since conceptualization at OVC 2010:<br
/><br
/><a href="https://guardianproject.info/2011/09/10/progress-on-mobile-video-privacy-tools/">https://guardianproject.info/2011/09/10/progress-on-mobile-video-privacy-tools/</a><br
/><br
/>Examples of usage on the ObscuraCam facebook page: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/obscuracam">https://www.facebook.com/obscuracam</a><br
/><br
/>Including this video demo: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXOKRShqYa0&feature=player_embedded">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXOKRShqYa0&amp;feature=player_embedded</a>&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Facial recognition in this functionality could also be used not only redact, but also to embed additional data (eg. intent/consent)<br
/><br
/>Points to other examples:<br
/>- Opencv face detection (check out videos illustrating usage - youtube opencv)<br
/>- Viewdle (Facial Recognition API) iOS SDK including comic Napoleon explaining...<br
/><br
/>There's the 'visual detection' side of the house, and the 'data' side - both parts of SSC.<br
/><br
/><b>Rich Jones -- OpenWatch</b><br
/><ul><li>Features<ul><li>iphone &amp; Android apps, records audio/video then gives option to upload to openwatch site, openwatch redacts by listening sensitive personally information (i.e. Social Security #s)</li
><li>i.e. citizen refuses DUI in San Diego -- <a href="http://openwatch.net/view/3543">http://openwatch.net/view/3543</a><ul><li>lead to investigation by state of CA</li></ul
></li
><li>Also a voice Dropbox, user dials phone # and records and submits to site</li></ul
></li
><li>Use cases<ul><li>Responding to a request to start using in Jamaica</li
><li>Activist in Chile used Synogen Mod to load the app based on ??swipe pattern??<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li
><li><b>LectureLeaks</b><ul><li>allows students to upload college lectures<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li></ul
>Philosophy = We are all under surveillance anyway, the public needs to derive benefit<br
/><br
/>What about security?<br
/><ul><li>OpenWatch app designed for simplicity. Adding layers of security adds layers of usability complication.<br/><br
/></li></ul
>Other technology examples<br
/><ul><li>yelp type app that uses security cameras to show what a scene looks like in real-time at a restaurant or commercial establishment</li
><li>Berkerley Open Courseware video software that keeps professor from getting in the way of whiteboard by referencing earlier frames and tracking professor<br/><br
/><br/><br
/></li></ul
>IDEAS<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * TemporalTagAutoSmooshVideo<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Google Earth Sat XVerify<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Auto-untagger<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Option to redact when someone tags you<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Gamification of anonymization/redaction<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Layers of access, multiple sources, ACL<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * VOICE manipulator<br

/>Sarah Knuckey: potential challenges thinking from human rights documentation perspective<br
/><ul><li>- Perpetrators removing selves&nbsp;</li
><li>- Victims (in future need for identification or proof)&nbsp;<ul><li>[possible to have reverse redaction that decrypts redaction back to original]</li
><li>use a key that a trusted source has/ + public key</li></ul
></li
><li>- In mass situations/Crowd situations</li
><li>- Does it really hide people?</li
><li>- Voice distortion&nbsp;<ul><li>(Guardian sees this as important, wants to implement)<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li></ul
>OpenCV allows "standards of redaction" to be identified<br
/><br
/>Nathan: On the decisions about putting something into the 'app' world; do you put it in the store or curate it/distribute it specifically? In app store, ObscuraCam is how you hide in keg parties. But if it was just for human right use, it would flag the users.<br
/><br
/>For evidentiary value: it's important to have reversible redaction, alongside signing of original value. Or could it be just a redaction of a part of the video, sustaining the evidentiary value of the other parts of the video.<br
/><br
/>Harlo: images have the visual data that we're used to understanding in the image (the image we see) + the data we don't see. Two sides to it.<br
/><br
/>Use scenario of obscura cam technology doesn't have to be for everyone, even if it's a small percentage it's an extremely valuable minority who needs to use it<br
/><br
/>Importance of cultural paradigms - around intent (of the creator), consent (of the subjects), anonymity, implications of sharing an image - may be greater than the actual tool itself.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Case in Afghanistan involving Physicians for Human Rights who discovered moving of mass graves, the discovery of the grave removal was used by satellite, but launched by human anectdotes, not pure scientific evidence at first.<br

/>GROUP BREAKOUT SESSIONS<br
/>=====================================<br
/><br
/><br
/><b><u>Repressive activism scenarios</u></b><br
/><br
/>Technical phenomenon take advantage of<br
/><br
/>What is the threat to address<br
/><br
/>Threat:&nbsp; People rounded up and retaliated against.<br
/><br
/><b>Risk Analysis</b> - Who are you?&nbsp; Are you getting caught up?&nbsp; Are you trying to be identified?<br
/><br
/>Challenges:<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Activists<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Authority&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Journalists<br
/><br
/>Trained People: could use system - planned action with deliberate intensions<br
/><br
/>Action as subject - wear mask, IR bulbs, paint, clothing<br
/><br
/>Application which gives recommendations - checklist<br
/>Risk Level - turn off cell phone/take out battery<br
/>OR alternative panic button<br
/><br
/>If you are an activist - do you want to get by standers?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>Risk to others<br
/><br
/><b>App as education tool</b><br
/><br
/>App that asks: Should all of these people be in this image?<br
/>We over-assume people understand the risk to themselves/presenting to others.<br
/><br
/>---<br
/><br
/>Who do you trust?? Region<br
/><br
/>'Think then click' - public social marketing around consent. Develop apps that help assess risk level. Inform users: How safe is this really?&nbsp; How long will it take?<br
/><br
/>For human rights situations, provide public keys for orgs who will accept footage (or have a public key that is shared with a trusted # of sources).<br
/><br
/>Good example of a more idiot-proof public key approach (noting that problem with public keys is complexity): "Viscosity+VyperVPN, as an example, makes securing your Internet connection against interception pretty idiot-proof."<br
/><br
/>Make sure to explain that encryption is not unbreakable, as is anonymization - but makes it harder. Question of 'how much effort to break' -&nbsp; locked box vs unbreakable.<br
/><br
/>Go with non-redacted version (to evidentiary repository/trusted source) and a then a redacted version (vs encrypted sections) for public distribution.<br
/><br
/>To ensure reach: how about having it as installed app on the devices when bought; or built into overall camera functionality? (which also has to do with manufacturers). Could incentivize a manufacturer to do from a market perspective? (Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Samsung?). Should this be put into the Google camera app source as a patch - get manufacturers using it. Build off Google cameras-source code as an easier path to reference design? Filter with the app<br
/><br
/>Tool that spits junk data - is there a way to effectively create chaf for human rights purposes.<br
/><br
/><b><u>Social media environment scenario</u></b><br
/><br
/>Have functionality that defaults to your name 'not being suggested' for tagging<br
/><br
/>Try and confuse the system, e.g. using Harlo's face, and trying to game Facebook (Rich's friend trying to do this with tagging of someone else as him - it works). Is there a way to use Facebook API to randomly tag people as you? or needs to be a composite face (in order to avoid tagging someone else as you who will suffer repercussions because of your ID; c.f. gay girl in damascus discussion from this am).<br
/><br
/><br
/><b><u>App-builders</u></b><br
/><br
/>We should build modular technology in pieces to put together in different ways<br
/><br
/>Bulding good libraries - that you can build from to use in multiple configurations.<br
/><br
/>Verification, obfuscation, redaction - draw on different libraries to create securesmartcam, openwatch. Drop into app-inventor to create own mix.<br
/><br
/>Globalleaks - opensource leaking platform launching = Rich, not a good idea, since don't want necessarily to lower the barrier to entry for secure data too low. People can't set up secure Wordpress most of the time, do you want them to have secure Wikileaks.<br
/><br
/>Voice distortion app. Could you use auto-tune or random warble.<br
/><br
