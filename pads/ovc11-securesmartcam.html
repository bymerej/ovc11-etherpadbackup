><b><u>INTRODUCTION&nbsp;</u></b><br
/><br
/><b>SecureSmartCam:</b> Nathan explains progress on the SecureSmartCam project.<br
/><br
/>See this blog post explaining progress since conceptualization at OVC 2010:<br

/><br
/>Examples of usage on the ObscuraCam facebook page: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/obscuracam">https://www.facebook.com/obscuracam</a><br
/><br
/>Including this video demo: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXOKRShqYa0&feature=player_embedded">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXOKRShqYa0&amp;feature=player_embedded</a>&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Facial recognition in this functionality could also be used not only redact, but also to embed additional data (eg. intent/consent)<br
/><br
/>Points to other examples:<br
/>- Opencv face detection (check out videos illustrating usage - youtube opencv)<br
/>- Viewdle (Facial Recognition API) iOS SDK including comic Napoleon explaining...<br
/><br
/>There's the 'visual detection' side of the house, and the 'data' side - both parts of SSC.<br
/><br
/><b>Rich Jones -- OpenWatch</b><br
/><ul><li>Features<ul><li>iphone &amp; Android apps, records audio/video then gives option to upload to openwatch site, openwatch redacts by listening sensitive personally information (i.e. Social Security #s)</li
><li>i.e. citizen refuses DUI in San Diego -- <a href="http://openwatch.net/view/3543">http://openwatch.net/view/3543</a><ul><li>lead to investigation by state of CA</li></ul
></li
><li>Also a voice Dropbox, user dials phone # and records and submits to site</li></ul
></li
><li>Use cases<ul><li>Responding to a request to start using in Jamaica</li
><li>Activist in Chile used Synogen Mod to load the app based on ??swipe pattern??<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li
><li><b>LectureLeaks</b><ul><li>allows students to upload college lectures<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li></ul
>Philosophy = We are all under surveillance anyway, the public needs to derive benefit<br
/><br
/>What about security?<br
/><ul><li>OpenWatch app designed for simplicity. Adding layers of security adds layers of usability complication.<br/><br
/></li></ul
>Other technology examples<br
/><ul><li>yelp type app that uses security cameras to show what a scene looks like in real-time at a restaurant or commercial establishment</li
><li>Berkerley Open Courseware video software that keeps professor from getting in the way of whiteboard by referencing earlier frames and tracking professor<br/><br
/><br/><br
/></li></ul
>IDEAS<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * TemporalTagAutoSmooshVideo<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Google Earth Sat XVerify<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Auto-untagger<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Option to redact when someone tags you<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Gamification of anonymization/redaction<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Layers of access, multiple sources, ACL<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * VOICE manipulator<br

/>Sarah Knuckey: potential challenges thinking from human rights documentation perspective<br
/><ul><li>- Perpetrators removing selves&nbsp;</li
><li>- Victims (in future need for identification or proof)&nbsp;<ul><li>[possible to have reverse redaction that decrypts redaction back to original]</li
><li>use a key that a trusted source has/ + public key</li></ul
></li
><li>- In mass situations/Crowd situations</li
><li>- Does it really hide people?</li
><li>- Voice distortion&nbsp;<ul><li>(Guardian sees this as important, wants to implement)<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li></ul
>OpenCV allows "standards of redaction" to be identified<br
/><br
/>Nathan: On the decisions about putting something into the 'app' world; do you put it in the store or curate it/distribute it specifically? In app store, ObscuraCam is how you hide in keg parties. But if it was just for human right use, it would flag the users.<br
/><br
/>For evidentiary value: it's important to have reversible redaction, alongside signing of original value. Or could it be just a redaction of a part of the video, sustaining the evidentiary value of the other parts of the video.<br
/><br
/>Harlo: images have the visual data that we're used to understanding in the image (the image we see) + the data we don't see. Two sides to it.<br
/><br
/>Use scenario of obscura cam technology doesn't have to be for everyone, even if it's a small percentage it's an extremely valuable minority who needs to use it<br
/><br
/>Importance of cultural paradigms - around intent (of the creator), consent (of the subjects), anonymity, implications of sharing an image - may be greater than the actual tool itself.&nbsp;<br
