The Missing Link: Flash to HTML5

Zohar Babin, Kaltura
Silvia Pfeiffer, Google

== Where do you think we should go with HTML5?
* ease of use; e.g. drag and drop API is 3 lines in Flash, but really complicated in HTML5
* lack of authoring tools
* fragmentation of features
* is innovation getting in the way of colaboration?

== Use Cases ==

* AppendBytes, editable byte arrays, the netstream--Dependent on OS media framework
** Low Level Video apis
** DVR (high speed seeking within buffers) on livestreams
** netstream file construction
*** Adaptive Streaming
*** Video Editing


sourceAppend API: http://html5-mediasource-api.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/draft-spec/mediasource-draft-spec.html

canvas.getMediaStream() is another way forward

* DRM
** What hooks do we need
** data over RTP
** encryption key should be published
** secure key exchange
** proxy opaque DRM messages over HTTP
