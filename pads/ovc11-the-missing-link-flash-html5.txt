The Missing Link: Flash to HTML5

Zohar Babin, Kaltura
Silvia Pfeiffer, Google

== Where do you think we should go with HTML5?
* ease of use; e.g. drag and drop API is 3 lines in Flash, but really complicated in HTML5
* lack of authoring tools
* fragmentation of features
* is innovation getting in the way of colaboration?
