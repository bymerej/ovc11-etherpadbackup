/><br
/>right to privacy is right to control information about yourself<br
/>bad idea to make it privacy versus something else<br
/><br
/><ul><li>that makes it come in the way of something else good<br/><br
/></li></ul
>"contextual integrity"<br
/><br

/>Databases like choicepoint<br
/><br
/>NYLS has "no camera" parties which indicates a subconsious awareness of visual privacy<br
/><br
/>Sam<br
/><br
/><b>Five Scenario Areas</b><br
/><ul><li><br/></li
><li>Facebook Users in the Global North (i.e. USA)</li
><li>The existance of an history that's always on the record has already begun to alter behavior of individuals who now self-censor to ensure that information does not get put up online.<br/><br
/></li></ul
>Jillian<br
/><br
/>Lebanon is more "liberal" country in Arab middle east, has support for gay community<br
/><ul><li>Activist in Lebanon stopped worrying about online exposure.&nbsp;</li
><li>Then learned Mom joined Facebook, changed perspective<br/><br
/><br/><br
/></li></ul
>i.e. Gay girl in Demascus hoax in Syria -- outed a photo of a lesbian in London without her intention<br
/><br
/>Film called "What remains of Us" only shown in a theater in Tibet with infrared sensors to make sure nobody was filming.<br
/><ul><li>Didn't blur out faces, why? Because the face is the expression. Aesthetics are difficult to balance with anonymity.<br/><br
/></li></ul
>Sam -- issues of misappropriation, i.e. Vancouver Riots, people were assumed as criminals for posing in front of vandalism<br
/><ul><li>problematic because of issues of due process<br/><br
/></li></ul
>i.e. Anonymous arrests -- 22 photo mug shots of those arrested posted by a lawyer pre-trial<br
/><ul><li>issue of due process<br/><br
/></li></ul
><b>Key questions raised</b>:<br
/><br
/>1. Helen - What values and purposes underpinning information flow controls are being disrupted by technological changes? What are the privacy harms in different contexts - we need to understand the implementation of these systems in different contexts.<br
/><br
/>2. If a current problem is the lack of conscious, privacy-minded decision making on the part of users, is the solution to try and get them to make those decisions in an informed way, or should we look for a technical solution that doesn't take as much time and effort?&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>3. Given that it is so difficult to retract an online personality (once "out") how can we better protect activists who in their work necessarily have public profiles?<br
/><br
/>4. Who has the "right" to anonymity?<br
/><br
/>5. Nathan - there can be aesthetic incompatibilities for storytellers and documentary makers between making human rights cases compelling and powerful and providing complete visual anonymity for activists - are there ways to address this?<br
/><br
/>6. If your image is collected in connection with a riot/protest/officially surveilled action, how does it impact due process rights to be identified de facto as a "rioter," "protester" or participant? Is this different (or do we think of it differently) in different contexts (from Iran to Vancouver to London)?&nbsp;<br
/><br
/><br
/>Rich Jones - In favor of more surveillance<br
/><ul><li>Surveillance is already happening, it's only going to get worse, the intrusion will increase<ul><li>therefore we need to level the playing field and get the public involved to drive benefits<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li
><li>Openwatch -- project for public to monitor authority figures, i.e. cops<ul><li>Majority of people have instant access to cameras</li
><li>Openwatch posts police abuse as well as positive police actions<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li></ul
>It's correct, I think, to point out that right now the trend seems to be toward the powerful (and the government in particular) having increased control over their online presence; this in part comes from the connection between resources and control over the direction of innovation.<br
/><br
/><b>What are the ways to address some of these issues? What are possible solutions?</b><br
/><ul><li>Public Policy level<ul><li>You should at least have the right to FOIA-like&nbsp; access on what reports private sources have about you.<ul><li>related to helen nissenbaum's idea of 'information flow' and contextual integrity<ul><li>But not sufficient: imbalance of power still exists when the government/private sources have the entire collection and can aggregate it, when you only have your own.</li></ul
></li></ul
></li
><li>Legal precedent with being forced to hand over encryption key<ul><li>i.e. ??woman insurance case?? she refused to hand over encryption key to her hard drive to the courts, case is pending but she seems to be ??winning?? on grounds of 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination</li></ul
></li></ul
></li
><li>Corporate Policy level<ul><li><a href="http://my.nameis.me">http://my.nameis.me</a> -- Examples of who is harmed by real name policies, campaign to change Google+ policy<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li
><li>Cultural level<ul><li>Maybe if more 'shaming' is likely, like in British riots, then the criminal-consequences should change.&nbsp; If no one wants to be shamed, there can at least be less power by the system</li
><li>changing the way we think of privacy - not a question of whether our data is safe, but to what extent it is safe, for how long. Not up to people to manage their information, requires developments at systematic level to measure risk, understanding who controls<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li
><li>Personal level<ul><li>Understanding risk analysis. Anyone can track you but are they? What are you willing to sacrifice<ul><li>??Nate from the Guardian Project?? is two degrees from Julian Assange, it's pretty well known but he hasn't been stopped by authorities</li></ul
></li
><li>There are levels of privilege. Some people can get a job and still have party photos</li
><li>If you're in a small town people already know who you are vs. a city.</li></ul
></li
><li>Tech development level</li></ul
>- The people who develop tools and platforms can have a limited understanding of how the technology affects citizens in completely different contexts to the users they imagine they are designing for - particularly for activists in places like Syria for example.<br
/><br
/>Any individual intermediary tends not to consider it their own responsibility to provide for&nbsp; anonymity/data protection--but when we all have to speak through intermediaries--usually multiple intermediaries--to speak, and no one individually feels it is their responsibility, the information environment is one where free speech is suppressed.<br
/><br
/>False public sphere/private sphere dichotomy in the digital age - it is not always clear what information is being shared "publically", which has reverberations in the legal sphere as there is no adequate definitions<br
/><br
/>For example - recent push by the Philadelphia PD to get private business owners to register their cameras with the police department, essentially using private resources to gather evidence of crimes. The Philly ACLU currently doesn't see a legal problem here (and they're right) but is there an ethical problem? Where's the line between evidence-gathering and privacy violation?<br
/><br
/>THe gray areas where privacy is nuanced<br
/>There is no such thing as digital media content that can be created and shared in a controlled way?<br
/><br
/><b>Interesting demonstrations of privacy awareness/personal management</b><br

><li>Using Google alerts on names too know what is being put out there&nbsp;</li
><li>Online identity management tools - Is it naive to think that this is a solution given lack of transparency in much broader data surveillance and tracking?<ul><li>Rich Jones - it's naive because public data is just the tip of the iceberg<br/><br
