== Standards for Browser Video Playback Metrics

Zachary Ozer (JWPlayer)

* start off with demo of Flash with adaptive bitrate switching and metrics
  * shows bandwidth
  * shows size of video (width x height)
  * shows dropped frames
  * shows switching between different levels
* there is no way to do this in HTML5 right now

Use cases:
* gathering engagement data
* adaptive bitrate switching
* playback quality monitoring & dropped frames
* network congestion monitoring & devices in specific areas

What metrics/statistics have the frameworks implemented:
* Zach shows a table with the existing proprties as fimplemented by Firefox and Chrome, as well as the existing proposal and what other frameworks implement (Silverlight, Flash etc)
* current proposal:
  * bytesReceived
  * bytesDecoded
  * decodedFrames
  * droppedFrames
  * presentedFrames
  * playbackJitter
* are these good metrics? what else do we need?

Discussion:
* frames per second is a bad metric - what does it give you? maybe something like percentage of frames not displayed would be better?
