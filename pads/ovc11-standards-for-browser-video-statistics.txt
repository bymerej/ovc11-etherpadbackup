== Standards for Browser Video Playback Metrics

Zachary Ozer (JWPlayer)
Pablo Schklowsky (JWPlayer)

* start off with demo of Flash with adaptive bitrate switching and metrics
  * shows bandwidth
  * shows size of video (width x height)
  * shows dropped frames
  * shows switching between different levels
* there is no way to do this in HTML5 right now

Use cases:
* gathering engagement data for analytics
* adaptive bitrate switching
* playback quality monitoring & dropped frames for measuring the user experience
* network congestion monitoring & devices in specific areas
* page visibility / tab visibility management
* electricity consumption

What metrics/statistics have the frameworks implemented:
* Zach shows a table with the existing proprties as fimplemented by Firefox and Chrome, as well as the existing proposal and what other frameworks implement (Silverlight, Flash etc)
* current proposal:
  * bytesReceived
  * bytesDecoded
  * decodedFrames
  * droppedFrames
  * presentedFrames
  * playbackJitter
* are these good metrics? what else do we need?

Discussion:
* frames per second is a bad metric - what does it give you? maybe something like percentage of frames not displayed would be better? maybe measuring the accumulated time that a clock has been stopped/delayed?
* there is an optimal playback quality; a counter that accumulates the lateness of frames can help, but then you cannot catch up with changes; you either need to define a window or be able to reset the counter to do useful measurements
* you want to be able to separate out whether a frame latency comes from a network or a CPU issue
* there are two main use cases: measure whether a user's experience is good after-the-fact and collect data to adapt the delivery to improve the user's experience in real-time

What is missing from the current proposal?
