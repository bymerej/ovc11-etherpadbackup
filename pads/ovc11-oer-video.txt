 * Identify challenges and gaps in the open education landscape with regard to video
 * Identify potential opportunities and collaborations
 * Identify principles, values and standards for this field
 * Share experiences and brainstorm innovative strategies
 * Cross pollinate ideas between different areas within this community, such as higher education, public media, secondary education, youth empowerment, online learning and digital literacy
 * Achieve consensus on one or two technical/design challenges/gaps in the field that are the most pressing, to be addressed at the Mozilla Drumbeat Festival in November

Engagement Online: What works for learning?

Demo/example: hyper-audio.org/r/
 popcorn.js based - synced audio and video with a raining transcript
 text color changes based on who is speaking
 interactive transcript that allows users to jump to specific content

Demo/example: student created videos, which are a remix of http://www.rebelliouspixels.com/semanticremix/, with different videos

Mediathread.ccnmtl.columbia.edu: 
looking for partners - happy to setup demo accounts.

Noticing self-organizing groups. ex; skillshare startup
How can video be best harnessed to engage people within a colloboration

overlay video feeds of people watching (live) an openvideo lecture so that it turns watching an openvideo into a community activity. Can see other people raise hands, etc.

Question: how do you ensure diversity within online learning communities? 

newmedia.ufm.edu/gsm
Nice video clipping and sharing options

pbskids.org
Forces user interaction with linear video - play along 

pbskids.org/electriccompany
smashup tools - create and watch video smashups

Licensing OER Content

Instructors take pains to construct their material... related to UCB's no derivs.

MIT Mission: content repository. They hope others will take it and make it useful. Institutional decision to use NC.

MIT faculty -- saw people becoming rockstars via MITOCW, encouraged each other.

90% or 100% of students who go to MIT have looked at OCW before applying

Hewlett is requiring most open license for open materials they fund -- wondering why?

If foundation is funding you -- they want the material to be of maximal usefulness. They want to allow improvements.

Saylor: Interested in diff between BY and BY-NC. Following Hewlett's lead on CC-BY

UCB: Wants to retain control... important to maintain context around material. 

What's the most interesting use of your material that you've seen?

MIT: Guy in Hati learned EE from our site and started building solar panels and grew it into a business

This goes back to the idea of traditional education being replaced

An org is working with Walmart to offer open edu courses to employees for management and professional development

Licenses help users know how they can/can't use stuff


Nuts & Bolts of Tools

How to effectively evaluate tools vs. the cost of development, assessment, and implementation.
-maintaining our ability to have a strategic vision for the future and  being open to new opportunities while being careful to be good stewards  of the programs and resources we are responsible for.

Potential solutions:
Engaging in/using open source software solutions
-may not get exactly what you need, but might save some of the effort  you would have to expend if you are doing it all by yourself

Software as a service
-if based on open source software, can be very cost effective way to deliver services to your community

Proprietary solutions
-locked into business model and feature roadmap of the commercial entity
-not customizable
-costly

What is a holistic approach to engage tools?
Is the functionality of layered engage tools on top of video enough/too much?
Where do we invest our time?
What is the value of these deeper tools to the students?

How can we do more with less?

It's important to have a record of truth with regard to the assets and  metadata that you publish. As your catalog of content grows, it will be  harder and harder to maintain information manually. Having the canonical  record of truth allows you to implement machine processes for future  needs that are difficult to articulate in the present, but we know they  will be there.

Wherever possible, stick to open standards.

Inclusive Design

Accessibility is about equitable access to the materials and content that is produced or published
 
Equitable access is important because it is fair
 
Designing for everyone creates a better product

Challenges:
Retrofit accessibilty - moving towards default, but it is a lot expect from original creator of content

value and impact of accessibility for OER

Personas for OER users
who - personality, set of goals
where/when - they are doing their learning
how - what are the teaching methods, collaborative or independant
What - we design as OER for curricula

Bessy, lives in a r area of US/Canada no highspeed or broadband - land line
Retirement age - 65 yr old
independent/lifelong learner
interested in learning gardening - hosting a wedding at her yard, wants to get her yard in tip top shape

looking to satisfy intellectual curioustiy - does sudoku - heard about OER and would like to check it out

Bessy is avid patron of her local library

social/community network that builds itself around open educational resources 

have it read to you over the phone
have it printed out
send mix tape of OER audio

voice enabled access to oer via touchtone phones
that plays recordings of OER textbooks.

facilitated learning meet up network

express interest via phone number - then if enough people call in with an interest, then they build a meeting around it.
