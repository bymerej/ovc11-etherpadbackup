/><br
/>Discussion:<br
/>* What's missing in the WebM ecosystem?<br
/>&nbsp; * what features should be added?<br
/>&nbsp; * what challenges are not yet being addressed?<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp; * Could the WebM project be run better?<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * How can the community become more involved?<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * How do we go about developing the next free video codec?<br
/><br
/><br
/>* WebM team says they are still learning how to run a community project.<br
/>* There should be more sharing of what the team members are working on with the community.<br
/>* Lots of communication is happening in video conferences. Maybe it should be moved to a hang-out.<br
/>* Issue tracker on code.google.com is public. Working with the community through the bug tracker can be really productive.<br
/>* Peer review on all commits could be useful.<br
/>* On releases when improvements are announced it would be helpful to actually provide examples that others can replicate that show the improvement.<br
