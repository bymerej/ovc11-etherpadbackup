We identified a key set of *nouns* and a key set of *adjectives* that can apply to the nouns.

Nouns:
 * Standards (e.g. encoding formats)
 * Hardware (cameras, computers, mobile phones, etc.)
 * Software, divided into players and tools (editors, etc.)
 * Distribution (e.g. YouTube, broadcast TV)
 * Social (education, cultural encouragement to make video) 
 * Content (the video itself)

Adjectives
 * Cost-free (free as in beer)
 * Legally free (free as in free speech)
 * Accessable (can and do people actually use it)
 * Participatory (can and do people take part in shaping it)

Symbols:
o = yes
x =no 
- = neutral
? = unknown
