<body><b>Key questions/challenges:</b><br
/><br
/>Sarah - Perpetrator shot video only evidence of abuses in Sri Lanka (mobile video of extrajudicial killings)...illicited public outrage and led to UN investigation. But perpetrators also becoming increasingly sophisticated in how they counter such allegations. Requires new tools, training to be able to bridge the knowledge gap. Highlights importance of identifying other methods, less resource intensive, more accessible.<br
/><br
/>Bradley - B'Tselem case of demonstrator´s death - ballistics information, aerial maps, photos post facto, a lot of documentation from day of the protest, syncing video from different vantage points, mapping trajectory of missile<br
/><br
/>Forensic architectural analysis.&nbsp; demonstrator killed by a gas canister round fired directly at victim.&nbsp; Legal question as to whether laws were broken with regard to the soldier's firing orders.<br

>Possibilties of leveraging this kind of evidence in a legal setting but also in advocacy<br
/><br
/>David - Storyful - a news agency built for the social media age. Mediates/curates citizen/user created media for major news outlets to disseminate.<br
/>Clients are major news agencies who want to know three things<br
/><ul><li>What content is out there</li
><li>What content is verified/accurate</li
><li>How the content fits into the larger story<br/><br
/></li></ul
>Example of unverified violent video from Syria, apparently showed execution of protester.<br
/>Here's how Storyful verified within a few hours to guide news publishers<br
/><ul><li>The human algorithm<ul><li>that video {{<a href="http://storyful.com/stories/1000007681">http://storyful.com/stories/1000007681</a>}} originally showed up on Facebook<ul><li>shot by the soldier themselves, had to investigate, how did it get onto facebook if a soldier shot it<ul><li>Did a soldier sell the video for someone else to post? (it happens)</li></ul
></li></ul
></li></ul
></li
><li>Forensic process<ul><li>What kind of weapons did the video show</li
><li>What accents did soldiers speak with, how does the street look, does the weather match<ul><li>They matched buildings with Google Earth images to verify location was Homs, Syria<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li></ul
></li></ul
>Example of video doctored by Syrian government<br
/><ul><li>Storyful advised not to use video, match river on Google maps, was dryer.<br/><br
/></li></ul
>Example of Ivory Coast<br
/><br
/>Issues:<br
/>1. video take-downs almost automatically - we do not know why, perhaps because of graphic images. Crucial that it is preserved if taken down from social media platforms. (Storyful does this)<br
/>2. counter narratives to explain context of videos - disparity between Syrian authorities version and opposition groups (or international advocates/media who sometimes assume version of events before verification) -- verification is helped by increased contact via social networks with people on the ground in Syria, Ivory Coast, &amp;c., contacts that traditional journalism doesn't immediately identify or value (large part of Storyful's verification is social networking awareness) i.e. the human algorithm<br
/>3. Storyful needs corroborating evidence that a video is not only real but that it is relevant NOW as news content i.e. that it is in fact what it appears to be, and is showing what is purported&nbsp;<br
/>4. This can happen in real-time more easily than weeks or months afterwards - see more journalists and human rights activists working together to corroborate, sharing information and helping both sides of the argument.<br
