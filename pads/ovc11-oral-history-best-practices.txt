These questions depend on what kind of a project you're working on. 

There are some associations for this field:
    - Oral History Association
        http://www.oralhistory.org/
    - International Oral History Association
        http://iohanet.org/
    
Q: What about the resources you guys are using and developing? Could this be applied to archives that have older media that need to converted/ brought into the digital?
A: 

Q: Working from the assumption that these assets are going to be remixed? We're wrestling with that assumption. So how do you embed these issues into the content. How do we embed values into the video itself and how it can be used in remix? Could you encode the consent and intent (of the narrator) into the metadata of the video so that when it enters remix culture those are clear to potential users? (outside of the original relationship of the creator to the narrator).  How do we encourage an open video system that respect privacy issues?

Blog post on some of these issues: http://blog.witness.org/2010/11/the-ethical-engagements-of-human-rights-social-media/

USC Shoah using elements of remix (or at least reuse) with USC students: http://dornsife.usc.edu/vhi/studentvoices/

The Shoah Visual History archive is used in the classroom at USC's Institute for Multimedia Literacy (IML 340: The Praxis of New Media) - http://cinema.usc.edu/iml/programs/course/imlcourses/iml340.cfm

Q: Using popcorn to could provide this kind of context/ convey these concerns?
A: Beyond remix, important to keep in mind how scholarly research has engaged citation, and how that can be considered when using metadata

- Do people use Creative Commons (http://creativecommons.org/) license in the Oral History community? As the field becomes less 'professionalized,' what are some adaptative methods? Could we use a type of Creative Commons lice

- Example of EFF v. Burning Man  - https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/08/snatching-rights-playa

- Digital Rights Management might have applications in these situations that people may not have thought through

- What systems are people in the room using to story their media?

- Filmmaker speaks up
    - Concerns about what to do with this archive accrued in the filmmaking process
    - Some of this material is sensitive
    
- As more people create media, this becomes a bigger issue
