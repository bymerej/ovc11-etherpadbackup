/><br
/><b>Engagement Online: What works for learning?</b><br
/><br
/>Demo/example: hyper-audio.org/r/<br
/>&nbsp;popcorn.js based - synced audio and video with a raining transcript<br
/>&nbsp;text color changes based on who is speaking<br
/>&nbsp;interactive transcript that allows users to jump to specific content<br
/><br
/>Demo/example: student created videos, which are a remix of <a href="http://www.rebelliouspixels.com/semanticremix/">http://www.rebelliouspixels.com/semanticremix/</a>, with different videos<br
/><br
/>Mediathread.ccnmtl.columbia.edu:&nbsp;<br
/>looking for partners - happy to setup demo accounts.<br
/><br
/>Noticing self-organizing groups. ex; skillshare startup<br
/>How can video be best harnessed to engage people within a colloboration<br
/><br
/>overlay video feeds of people watching (live) an openvideo lecture so that it turns watching an openvideo into a community activity. Can see other people raise hands, etc.<br
/><br
/>Question: how do you ensure diversity within online learning communities?&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>newmedia.ufm.edu/gsm<br
/>Nice video clipping and sharing options<br
/><br
/>pbskids.org<br
/>Forces user interaction with linear video - play along&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>pbskids.org/electriccompany<br
/>smashup tools - create and watch video smashups<br
/><br

/><br
/><b>Licensing OER Content</b><br
/><br
/>Instructors take pains to construct their material... related to UCB's no derivs.<br
/><br
/>MIT Mission: content repository. They hope others will take it and make it useful. Institutional decision to use NC.<br
/><br
/>MIT faculty -- saw people becoming rockstars via MITOCW, encouraged each other.<br
/><br
/>90% or 100% of students who go to MIT have looked at OCW before applying<br
/><br
/>Hewlett is requiring most open license for open materials they fund -- wondering why?<br
/><br
/>If foundation is funding you -- they want the material to be of maximal usefulness. They want to allow improvements.<br
/><br
/>Saylor: Interested in diff between BY and BY-NC. Following Hewlett's lead on CC-BY<br
/><br
/>UCB: Wants to retain control... important to maintain context around material.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>What's the most interesting use of your material that you've seen?<br
/><br
/>MIT: Guy in Hati learned EE from our site and started building solar panels and grew it into a business<br
/><br
/>This goes back to the idea of traditional education being replaced<br
/><br
/>An org is working with Walmart to offer open edu courses to employees for management and professional development<br
/><br
/>Licenses help users know how they can/can't use stuff<br
/><br
/><br
/><b>Nuts &amp; Bolts of Tools</b><br
/><br
/>How to effectively evaluate tools vs. the cost of development, assessment, and implementation.<br
/>-maintaining our ability to have a strategic vision for the future and&nbsp; being open to new opportunities while being careful to be good stewards&nbsp; of the programs and resources we are responsible for.<br
/><br
/>Potential solutions:<br
/>Engaging in/using open source software solutions<br
/>-may not get exactly what you need, but might save some of the effort&nbsp; you would have to expend if you are doing it all by yourself<br
/><br
/>Software as a service<br
/>-if based on open source software, can be very cost effective way to deliver services to your community<br
/><br
/>Proprietary solutions<br
/>-locked into business model and feature roadmap of the commercial entity<br
/>-not customizable<br
/>-costly<br
/><br
/>What is a holistic approach to engage tools?<br
/>Is the functionality of layered engage tools on top of video enough/too much?<br
/>Where do we invest our time?<br
/>What is the value of these deeper tools to the students?<br
/><br
/>How can we do more with less?<br
/><br
/>It's important to have a record of truth with regard to the assets and&nbsp; metadata that you publish. As your catalog of content grows, it will be&nbsp; harder and harder to maintain information manually. Having the canonical&nbsp; record of truth allows you to implement machine processes for future&nbsp; needs that are difficult to articulate in the present, but we know they&nbsp; will be there.<br
/><br
/>Wherever possible, stick to open standards.<br
/><br
/><b>Inclusive Design</b><br
/><br
/>Accessibility is about equitable access to the materials and content that is produced or published<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>Equitable access is important because it is fair<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>Designing for everyone creates a better product<br
/><br
/>Challenges:<br
/>Retrofit accessibilty - moving towards default, but it is a lot expect from original creator of content<br
/><br
/>value and impact of accessibility for OER<br
/><br
/>Personas for OER users<br
/>who - personality, set of goals<br
/>where/when - they are doing their learning<br
/>how - what are the teaching methods, collaborative or independant<br
/>What - we design as OER for curricula<br
/><br
/>Bessy, lives in a rural area of US/Canada no highspeed or broadband - land line<br
/>Retirement age - 65 yr old<br
/>independent/lifelong learner<br
/>interested in learning gardening - hosting a wedding at her yard, wants to get her yard in tip top shape<br
/><br
/>looking to satisfy intellectual curioustiy - does sudoku - heard about OER and would like to check it out<br
/><br
/>Bessy is avid patron of her local library<br
/><br
/>social/community network that builds itself around open educational resources&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>have it read to you over the phone<br
/>have it printed out<br
/>send mix tape of OER audio<br
/><br
/>voice enabled access to oer via touchtone phones<br
/>that plays recordings of OER textbooks.<br
/><br
/>facilitated learning meet up network<br
/><br
/>express interest via phone number - then if enough people call in with an interest, then they build a meeting around it.<br
/><br
/>downloadable part is a curriculum that maps the resources that are available in the area - an OER about OER<br
/><br
/>DVD on demand - filled with audio and video content<br
