=== Mark: Introduction to DASH

* MPEG is finalizing the DASH specification
* DASH is a manifest format for describing all available streams for a media resource
* DASH also defines file formats that are suitable for making use of this with MPEG-4 File Format; transport streams work "magically"
* there is also a common encryption scheme for MPEG-4 file format in DASH
* defined profiles: 2 for mp4, 2 for transport streams
* for transport streams there is a on-demand and a live profile:
  * on-demand profiles require alignment of files
  * live require chunking of the files
* example manifest
  * AdaptationSet: groups per resource or per track
  * Representation: different representations for same resource
  * muxed cases are difficult in particular to align the chunks
* features:
  * multiple tracks / accessibility
  * trick modes (e.g. deal with fast forward by dropping to lower framerate)
  * 3D, multi-view, scalable video
  * protected content
* implementation: Netflix is using this format
