<body>== Standards for HTTP Adaptive Streaming<br
/><br
/>Frank Galligan (Google)<br
/>Aaron Colwell (Google)<br
/>Mark Watson (Netflix)<br
/><br
/><br
/>=== Mark: Introduction to DASH<br
/><br
/>* MPEG is finalizing the DASH specification<br
/>* DASH is a manifest format for describing all available streams for a media resource<br
/>* DASH also defines file formats that are suitable for making use of this with MPEG-4 File Format; transport streams work "magically"<br
/>* there is also a common encryption scheme for MPEG-4 file format in DASH<br
/>* defined profiles: 2 for mp4, 2 for transport streams<br
/>* for transport streams there is a on-demand and a live profile:<br
/>&nbsp; * on-demand profiles require alignment of files<br
/>&nbsp; * live require chunking of the files<br
/>* example manifest<br
/>&nbsp; * AdaptationSet: groups per resource or per track<br
/>&nbsp; * Representation: different representations for same resource<br
/>&nbsp; * muxed cases are difficult in particular to align the chunks<br
/>* features:<br
/>&nbsp; * multiple tracks / accessibility<br
/>&nbsp; * trick modes (e.g. deal with fast forward by dropping to lower framerate)<br
/>&nbsp; * 3D, multi-view, scalable video<br
/>&nbsp; * protected content<br
/>* implementation: Netflix is using this format<br
/><br
/>Comments:<br
/>* the DASH file format is very complex and could be simplified and not require such a complicated parser<br
/>* to implement it with Matroska, you will need to extract the Matroska cluster index<br
/>* nicely arranged media in chunks and index them (when authoring) really helps to simplify the adaptive streaming<br
/>* example bitstreams and implementations are in the process of being developed in MPEG<br
/><br
/><br
/>=== Aaron: Media Source API<br
/><br
/>* implemented in Chrome for adaptive streaming, but may be applicable to other use cases<br
/>* an extension to HTMLMediaElement that allos to pipe data into audio and video, similar to appendBytes in Flash<br
/>* stream switching, buffering, delivery, manifest strategies should not be done by the browser - the browser just provides an API to dynamically create content<br
/>* supports adaptive streaming, mashups, ad insertion, streaming services, DVR, video editors (constraint editing)<br
/>* proposed IDL:<br
/><br
/>interface HTMLMediaElement : HTMLElement {<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // URL passed to src attribute to enable the media source logic.<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; readonly attribute DOMString webkitMediaSourceURL;<br
/><br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Appends media to to the source.<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void webkitSourceAppend(in Uint8Array data) raises (DOMException);<br
/><br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Signals the end of stream.<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const unsigned short EOS_NO_ERROR = 0; // End of stream reached w/o error.<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const unsigned short EOS_NETWORK_ERR = 1; // A network error triggered end of stream.<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const unsigned short EOS_DECODE_ERR = 2; // A decode error triggered end of stream.<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void webkitSourceEndOfStream(in unsigned short status) raises (DOMException);<br
/><br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Indicates the current state of the media source.<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const unsigned short SOURCE_CLOSED = 0;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const unsigned short SOURCE_OPEN = 1;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const unsigned short SOURCE_ENDED = 2;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; readonly attribute unsigned short webkitSourceState;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ....<br
/>};<br
/><br
/>&nbsp; * special URL that the browser advertises: webkitMediaSourceURL (media data comes from JS)<br
/>&nbsp; * webkitSourceAppend() call with error handling<br
/>&nbsp; * webkitSourceEdnOfStream with states to manage stage handling<br
/>* browser doesn't care how JS gets the seek point and the time stamp - it just allows the JS developer to deal with it<br
/>* you would use JS to parse the Ogg packets<br
/>* Draft spec available: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3aqpknx">http://tinyurl.com/3aqpknx</a><br
/>* supports playback of a minimalist WebM byte stream (INFO, TRACKS, CLUSTER)<br
/>* supports muxed &amp; demuxed streams<br
/>* bulk of code is check into WebKit and Chromium, but #ifdef-ed out; about to add command-line flag<br
/>* two demos available: basic VOD&nbsp; &amp; adaptive streaming<br
/><br
/>Next steps:<br
/>* make byte stream look more like WebM live streams, so JS handling becomes easier<br
/>* implement frame size change &amp; possibly Vorbis codebook change support<br
/>* publish a byte stream spec for WebM<br
/>* release command-line flag in Chrome 16 to encourage demos to iron out issues<br
/>* find out how to support MP4 and Ogg with this API<br
/>* for Ogg providing an index to simplify seeking would help (this is essentially a shoutcast stream)<br
/>* start standardisation discussion at WHATWG<br
/><br
/><br
/>Have break-out group tomorrow about this!!!<br
/><br
/>Discussion:<br
/>* have you considered ad blocking as an application; we expect there will be the jquery equivalent for adaptive streaming<br
/>* problem with implementing adaptive streaming in the player is that it is hard to innovate; if we push that into JS, it is easier to improve and allow support; a more fundamental API for how to manipulate video is useful and the browser is just used as a playback engine<br
/>* don't use encoded frames, but clusters to give a nicer abstraction to the JS pl<br
