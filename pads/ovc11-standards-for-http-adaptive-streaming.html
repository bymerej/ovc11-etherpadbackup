<body>== Standards for HTTP Adaptive Streaming<br

/><br
/><br
/>=== Mark: Introduction to DASH<br
/><br
/>* MPEG is finalizing the DASH specification<br
/>* DASH is a manifest format for describing all available streams for a media resource<br
/>* DASH also defines file formats that are suitable for making use of this with MPEG-4 File Format; transport streams work "magically"<br
/>* there is also a common encryption scheme for MPEG-4 file format in DASH<br
/>* defined profiles: 2 for mp4, 2 for transport streams<br
/>* for transport streams there is a on-demand and a live profile:<br
/>&nbsp; * on-demand profiles require alignment of files<br
/>&nbsp; * live require chunking of the files<br
/>* example manifest<br
/>&nbsp; * AdaptationSet: groups per resource or per track<br
/>&nbsp; * Representation: different representations for same resource<br
/>&nbsp; * muxed cases are difficult in particular to align the chunks<br
/>* features:<br
/>&nbsp; * multiple tracks / accessibility<br
/>&nbsp; * trick modes (e.g. deal with fast forward by dropping to lower framerate)<br
/>&nbsp; * 3D, multi-view, scalable video<br
/>&nbsp; * protected content<br
/>* implementation: Netflix is using this format<br
/><br
/>Comments:<br
/>* the DASH file format is very complex and could be simplified and not require such a complicated parser<br
/>* to implement it with Matroska, you will need to extract the Matroska cluster index<br
/>* nicely arranged media in chunks and index them (when authoring) really helps to simplify the adaptive streaming<br
/>* example bitstreams and implementations are in the process of being developed in MPEG<br
/><br
/><br
/>=== Aaron: Media Source API<br
/><br
/>* implemented in Chrome for adaptive streaming, but may be applicable to other use cases<br
/>* an extension to HTMLMediaElement that allos to pipe data into audio and video, similar to appendBytes in Flash<br
/>* stream switching, buffering, delivery, manifest strategies should not be done by the browser - the browser just provides an API to dynamically create content<br
/>* supports adaptive streaming, mashups, ad insertion, streaming services, DVR, video editors (constraint editing)<br
/>* proposed IDL:<br
/>&nbsp; * special URL that the browser advertises: webkitMediaSourceURL (media data comes from JS)<br
/>&nbsp; * webkitSourceAppend() call with error handling<br
/>&nbsp; * webkitSourceEdnOfStream with states to manage stage handling<br
