/><br
/>Korsakow is not:<br
/>- a video-editor<br
/>- a video transcoder<br
/>- a motion graphic application<br
/>- a religion<br
/>- bulletproof (yet)<br
/><br
/>What is a SNU?<br
/><br
/>SNU (snoo) - smallest narrative unit<br
/>SNUs are the building blocks<br
/>The main task in korsakow is to SNUify<br
/>SNUifying involves keywording your time-based media assets.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Origin of the name "Korsakow"...<br
/>Having to do with the content of Florian's thesis, on alcohol consumption in Germany. One effect of esult of&nbsp; in... loss of short-term memory, a compulsion to tell stories.<br
/><br
/>Basic Workflow:&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Browser (online or local)<br
/>Interface (default)<br
/>Startscreen (static)<br
/>Preloader<br
/><br
/>File formats<br

/><br
/>A Korsakow film is different than the choose-your-own-adventure model&nbsp;<br
/>- discouraging mapping out before<br
/>- think of it as a cloud "you're entering into a cloud"<br

/>Florian Thalhofer<br
/>=================<br
/><br
/>A Korsakow film<br
/>A collection of connected SNUs<br
/><br
/>terms come from<br
/>University of Arts in Berlin professor<br
/><br
/>example - lithuanian students working on&nbsp;<br
/>student filmmakers asked "what's the story?"<br
/><br
/>who is the main protagonist?&nbsp;<br
/>how does he struggle?<br
/>who's the bad guy?<br
/>who's the good guy?<br
/>what's the moral?<br
/><br
/>what if you have a strong curiosme (sp?), but no story<br
/><br
/>we try to understand the world in stories... but what if that's only 2%<br
/><br
/>it is very things that are people are just good and bad&nbsp;<br
/>things just right and wrong<br

/>David Reisch<br
/>=================<br
/><br
/>Editor (desktop) &gt; scale, transcode&nbsp; ---&gt;&gt; XML/ Video/ Audio/ Images ---&gt; Player (web-based)<br
/><br
/>Korsakow Editor&nbsp;<br
/>1) Written in Java<br
/>2) a lot of help from QT, FFMpeg, LAME<br
/>3) A little help from Applescript, Bat (missed some here)<br
/><br
/>Korsakow Player<br
/>1) Written in AS<br
/>2) A lot of help from JS<br
/>3) A little help from jQuery, SWFAddress, SWFObject, Flex<br
/><br
/>QUESTIONS:<br
/><br
/>- What if someone submitted code that we weren't sure about?<br
/>- Considering making a transition to HTML5<br
/>- In terms of scope:<br
/>- sidestepping transcoding&nbsp;<br
/>- Perceptions: is Korsakow like iMovie? If I were a serious maker, why would I use it?<br
/>- Korsakow is dynamic, database storytelling - so it's not suited to something like Flash?&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Q: Questions about how keywods work ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>A: Keywords can be thematic, they can formal, it is up to the author<br
/><br
/>MS C: But we're looking to move into the next generation of the keywords...&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Depending on how you use the keywords, you can have a lot of control... but do you want all that control?<br
/><br
/>Q: How does the community work this system out?<br
/>A: When I screen the films, audience members have laser pointers and choose the next SNU. Korsakow show ... with live experts.<br
/><br
/>Q: What about drama?&nbsp;<br
/>A: Fragments is one example of this...&nbsp; / It has been mostly been used for documentary, but I think it would work well for a new form of storytelling.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>C: It's an open question: Is documentary leading in non-linear storytelling?<br
/>There is an example that I didn't show - Switches/ Maybe documentary is more open to multiple narrative arcs. Not completely let go of authorial control, but begin to...&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Q: Could Day in Life have been a Korsakow project... // wasn't really "crowd-sourced" ..&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Q: Are lives are linear, because time moves linearly.&nbsp;<br
/>A: FT - I think we think this is the way our lives work this way because our narratives move linearly.&nbsp;<br
/>MS - Life is more fundamentally nonlinear than it is linear.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Q/C: What do you have to say about Memento, Pulp Fiction<br
/><br
/>C: Art!<br
/><br
/>Q: Does linear and non-linear have to be mutually exclusive?<br
/><br
/>Q: They aren't mutually exclusive and sometimes viewers are in different modes/ moods at different times...&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Q: Have you put this in front of a group of game developers?<br
/>A: No, but its paths have been mapped before... here's the blogpost Florian and Matt were referencing - <a href="http://korsakow.org/korsakow-maps-out-feeling">http://korsakow.org/korsakow-maps-out-feeling</a><br

/><br
/>Thanks everyone for attending the workshop. Was fantastic to have so much interest and so many great questions. Please keep in touch. And a huge thank you to Veronica for transcribing the conversation.<br
