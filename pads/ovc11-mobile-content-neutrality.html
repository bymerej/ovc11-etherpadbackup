/><br
/><b>Introduction</b><br
/><br
/>policy and technology progressing together<br
/>wireless carriers - how much can they do with the netorks they control?<br
/>what role do we serve in compelling these carriers to open up the networks to allow different services?<br
/><br
/><b>Current State of Policies</b><br
/>practices of mobile carriers in low income communities blocking access - translating into the video space&nbsp;<br
/>January - cheapest plans not allowing access = clear content discrimination&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Net neutrality - uncertainty in the mobile space / how this will be affected [too much authority to make decisions without enough oversight]&nbsp;<br
/>wireline vs. wireless carriers - different rules applied&nbsp;<br
/><br
/><u>David Carter - Metro PCS</u><br
/>calls routed to place in rural Iowa - could call into telephone numbers to listen to radio news channels around the world [getting news directly from the source]&nbsp;<br
/>PCS began to see high volumes of traffic going to these numbers [increase volumes = moving telephone number into a blocked pattern]&nbsp;<br
/>- value of your unlimited long distance plan decreases if this is type of access you want&nbsp;<br
/>- Dist of Maryland Judge - wireless carrier be able to set pricing plans any way they wanted; asked Judge to go to FCC - REFUSED to even ask FCC to look at issue and analyze if this was a legal issue with the calling-block datat plan structure<br
/>&nbsp;[client made decision to pursue issue in Fed Dist court...blocking had just began to occur so wanted to receive a temporary injunction - and in FCC land may not be able to get this sort of fast paced injunctive relief&nbsp;<br
/>Carriers often effective and receive deference for the actions they are taking&nbsp;<br
/>in order to overcome challenges [content of video/app/phone call] - <i>you should be able to access any lawful content through any devic</i>e. NOT the carriers place to pick and choose the winners.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>COMMON CARRIER OBLIGATIONS<br
/>- anti discrimination principles that should be applied more broadly and clearly<br
/>- FCC implementing net neturality in different way depending if its wireless or wireline is a poor policy choice<br
/>- mergers = could be left with two carriers controlling entire wireless industry&nbsp;<br
/>[e.g. google - motorola...every time see consolidation in this industry takes away from consumer freedom]<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what is the business incentive after these mergers happen?&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do you even know if a delay is happening....human behavior = will just go to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; content that is easier to access w/o knowing these netowkr management practices are happen<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>- applying these policies based on idea of competition - which assume need less regulation&nbsp;<br
/>- i.e. text message blocking and campaigns [carriers make it cost prohibitive and time consuming, but this is most popular way to communicate in the US]&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>e.g. exempting own video service from its caps&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Filing Cases under the Net Neutrality Principles&nbsp;<br
/>- loking for courts that are hospitable / but then will see circuit splits? Will happen as rules come into effect<br
/>- FCC trying to walk delicate line b/c big pushpack from carriers having Title II common carrier obligations [concerns on what Conrgess would do if went in that direction] - this would have been the clearer path to get there&nbsp;<br
/>- will these current rules be upheld?<br
/><br
/><u>Wiki/Video Montage Project</u> - Amanda, MICC<br
/>- MICC: nonprofit texting company, wanted to make sure originally not getting blocked as a small business; last January born! Had to fiogure out how to come out with protocols appropriately;riginal purpose around basic consumer fairness -<br
/>how technologies can do social good through different mediums&nbsp;<br
/>- Asked by Commissioner to collect stories on the lack of innovation [we don't have enough to say how this is hurting anything yet] - want to collect stories on what people are afraid of what the mobile industry is doing. People scared if breaking laws because of their mobile activity.&nbsp;<br
/>- Wahington - ust not getting enough iormation and working within the bureaucratic structure&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>in order to empower decision/policy molving issues on national level - need to get the collective together; they can tell their stories. CHALLENGE is building the critical mass to explain what is happening.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>What If Generator&nbsp;<br
/>- wiki generating online "what if" paths if we had [i.e. open internet access to wireless networks]<br
/>-Services exist but NOT in a wide scale - i.e. CPU for animation - could rent more powerful machines, but impossible because of uploading issues&nbsp;<br
/>- designers and innovatorsscrepancy between downloadand upload speeds&nbsp;<br
/>- Open Access - why is this NOT the attractive models?&nbsp;<br
/><br
/><u>Additional Approaches to Addressing Issue</u> - Nick&nbsp;<br
/>NSA - became involved in huge lawsuit against FBI. lasted 8 years&nbsp;<br
/>organizations supporting lawsuit were more from literary, publishing, academic world rather than telecom world&nbsp;<br
/>lawsuit filed under "John Doe" = monk like existence&nbsp;<br
/>telecom service focused on privacy and the rights of consumers [CALYX]&nbsp;<br
/>Aug 2010 - partially released from gag order&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Originally - focused on privacy and right to anonymity<br
/>now - network neutrality and other issues coming into the mix&nbsp;<br
/>- many gray areas in the law that have become much more apparent post Sept 11 Patriot Act and other legislation [wants to test this in terms of their consitutionality]&nbsp;<br
/>Calyx will BE a telecommunications provider = VoIP, voice over service, CLEC&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>nonprofit route - profit mode was one of the main reasons big carriers NOT doing anything in this sphere&nbsp;<br
/>1. didnt want to make enemies within govt - do lots of gov't K work / lucrative&nbsp;<br
/>2. will come before regulatory bodies and don't want to risk not having favorable attention<br
/>&nbsp;[public relations - want to stay neutral b/c people on both sides who disagree]<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;Grassroots movement&nbsp;<br
/><u>&nbsp;</u><br
/><u>&nbsp;Non Neutral Conduct App</u> - Phillip&nbsp;<br
/>- DivPro - detects when a service is being degraded&nbsp;<br
/>Phil wants App that goes even further / but also what is the feasibility of this solution<br
/>technology in lace since how Comcast got caught<br
/>- Rob P. kept trynig to upload DNS that would not upload, so then trying to download other public domainstuff - discovered blockage&nbsp;<br
/>- are you getting speed that's advertised? - no tool yet to know if wired ISP is blocking or degrading; just are you getting advertsided speed = need to discover for yourself<br
/>- AT&amp;T blocking skype...was pretty obvious&nbsp;<br
/>Berkman Center - means to promote online censorship Herdict]&nbsp;<br
/>- how activits track whats blocked in repressive regimes [firewall]&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>BROAD principle rules - for when they go into effect<br
/>only way we will know what net neutrality means on practical level is by establishing series of new precedent of what these principles really stand for - so means some period of time with test cases&nbsp;<br
/>- area of law in which FCC will have any stat jurisdicitonal time limit in whcih to act<br
/>- FCC is famous for making NO decision [petitions that have been epnding for 10+ year] so concern is that if we don't organize people and give them tools to understand when there are violations, we will never have teeth going into these principles for enforcement purposes<br
/><br
/>ISP&nbsp;<br
/>No law requiring you to provide service to ISPs, unbundling rules affects the carrier when they provide telephone service - no right to access the network otherwise&nbsp;<br
/>- useful to think about different ISPs that are out there...smaller ISPs not required to be on best behavior, could this be a route for litigation and "test" cases [more regionally based] vs. someone with substantial backing behind them may not pan out with greater success&nbsp;<br
