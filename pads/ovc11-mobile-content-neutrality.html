/><br
/><b>Introduction</b><br
/><br
/>policy and technology progressing together<br
/>wireless carriers - how much can they do with the netorks they control?<br
/>what role do we serve in compelling these carriers to open up the networks to allow different services?<br
/><br
/><b>Current State of Policies</b><br
/>practices of mobile carriers in low income communities blocking access - translating into the video space&nbsp;<br
/>January - cheapest plans not allowing access = clear content discrimination&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Net neutrality - uncertainty in the mobile space / how this will be affected [too much authority to make decisions without enough oversight]&nbsp;<br
/>wireline vs. wireless carriers - different rules applied&nbsp;<br
/><br
/><u>David Carter - Metro PCS</u><br
/>calls routed to place in rural Iowa - could call into telephone numbers to listen to radio news channels around the world [getting news directly from the source]&nbsp;<br
/>PCS began to see high volumes of traffic going to these numbers [increase volumes = moving telephone number into a blocked pattern]&nbsp;<br
/>- value of your unlimited long distance plan decreases if this is type of access you want&nbsp;<br
/>- Dist of Maryland Judge - wireless carrier be able to set pricing plans any way they wanted; asked Judge to go to FCC - REFUSED to even ask FCC to look at issue and analyze if this was a legal issue with the calling-block datat plan structure<br
/>&nbsp;[client made decision to pursue issue in Fed Dist court...blocking had just began to occur so wanted to receive a temporary injunction - and in FCC land may not be able to get this sort of fast paced injunctive relief&nbsp;<br
/>Carriers often effective and receive deference for the actions they are taking&nbsp;<br
/>in order to overcome challenges [content of video/app/phone call] - <i>you should be able to access any lawful content through any devic</i>e. NOT the carriers place to pick and choose the winners.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>COMMON CARRIER OBLIGATIONS<br
/>- anti discrimination principles that should be applied more broadly and clearly<br
/>- FCC implementing net neturality in different way depending if its wireless or wireline is a poor policy choice<br
/>- mergers = could be left with two carriers controlling entire wireless industry&nbsp;<br
/>[e.g. google - motorola...every time see consolidation in this industry takes away from consumer freedom]<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what is the business incentive after these mergers happen?&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do you even know if a delay is happening....human behavior = will just go to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; content that is easier to access w/o knowing these netowkr management practices are happen<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>- applying these policies based on idea of competition - which assume need less regulation&nbsp;<br
/>- i.e. text message blocking and campaigns [carriers make it cost prohibitive and time consuming, but this is most popular way to communicate in the US]&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>e.g. exempting own video service from its caps&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Filing Cases under the Net Neutrality Principles&nbsp;<br
/>- loking for courts that are hospitable / but then will see circuit splits? Will happen as rules come into effect<br
/>- FCC trying to walk delicate line b/c big pushpack from carriers having Title II common carrier obligations [concerns on what Conrgess would do if went in that direction] - this would have been the clearer path to get there&nbsp;<br
/>- will these current rules be upheld?<br
/><br
/><u>Wiki/Video Montage Project</u> - Amanda, MICC<br
/>- MICC: nonprofit texting company, wanted to make sure originally not getting blocked as a sma<br
/>how technologies can do social good through different mediums&nbsp;<br
