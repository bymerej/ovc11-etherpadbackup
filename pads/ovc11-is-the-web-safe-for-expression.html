<body>Is the Internet Safe for Free Expression?<br
/><br
/>Jillian York, Trevor Timm, Richard Esguerra - EFF Activists<br
/><br
/>Discussion of:<br
/>Technology and how it bears on freedom of expression<br
/>Law<br
/>Policy<br
/>Web censorship (domestic and international)<br
/><br
/>Pseudonyms and Social Networks<br
/><ul><li>identity policies on social networks<ul><li>lots of complex ideas converge on this issue</li
><li>identity politics<ul><li>even the basic definition of identity</li></ul
></li></ul
></li
><li>some people use pseudonyms professionally</li
><li>some people require pseudonymity/anonymity for their personal safety</li
><li>intermediaries making rules for their platforms &lt;-- the main issue underlying these problems<ul><li>the government plays a role</li
><li>private companies and their terms and policies also play a role<ul><li>censorship by private companies currently has no corresponding legal remedy</li
><li>so the gov. can pressure private internet companies to censor without overt government involvement</li></ul
></li></ul
></li
><li>when google's legal team researched whether to drop wikileaks, they reported that no laws appeared to have been broken</li
><li>but most of the intermediaries that dropped WL when controversy arose didn't do that much research and didn't reach that level of legal comprehension before they took action<br/><br
/></li
><li>Your online freedom of expression is only as strong as the weakest intermediary.<ul><li>Lots of points where your expression can be cut off --&nbsp;<ul><li>web host (can cut off your access)</li
><li>the upstream ISP for the web host&nbsp;</li
><li>the domain name system (in the form of domain name seizure)<ul><li>cuts off access unless you know the IP address<br/><br
