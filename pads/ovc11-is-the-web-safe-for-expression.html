<body>Is the Internet Safe for Free Expression?<br
/><br
/>Jillian York, Trevor Timm, Richard Esguerra - EFF Activists<br
/><br
/>Discussion of:<br
/>Technology and how it bears on freedom of expression<br
/>Law<br
/>Policy<br
/>Web censorship (domestic and international)<br
/><br
/>Pseudonyms and Social Networks<br
/><ul><li>identity policies on social networks<ul><li>lots of complex ideas converge on this issue</li
><li>identity politics<ul><li>even the basic definition of identity</li></ul
></li></ul
></li
><li>some people use pseudonyms professionally</li
><li>some people require pseudonymity/anonymity for their personal safety</li
><li>intermediaries making rules for their platforms &lt;-- the main issue underlying these problems<ul><li>the government plays a role</li
><li>private companies and their terms and policies also play a role<ul><li>censorship by private companies currently has no corresponding legal remedy</li
><li>so the gov. can pressure private internet companies to censor without overt government involvement</li></ul
></li></ul
></li
><li>when google's legal team researched whether to drop wikileaks, they reported that no laws appeared to have been broken</li
><li>but most of the intermediaries that dropped WL when controversy arose didn't do that much research and didn't reach that level of legal comprehension before they took action<br/><br
/></li
><li>Your online freedom of expression is only as strong as the weakest intermediary.<ul><li>Lots of points where your expression can be cut off --&nbsp;<ul><li>web host (can cut off your access)</li
><li>the upstream ISP for the web host&nbsp;</li
><li>the domain name system (in the form of domain name seizure)<ul><li>cuts off access unless you know the IP address<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li></ul
></li></ul
></li
><li>PIPA (formerly known as COICA)&nbsp;<ul><li>routes around jurisdictional issues that previously kept the US from seizing domain names in other countries</li
><li>instead it tells the DNS not to resolve specific domain names (so this is an effective way to cut off US access to a top level domain that isn't w/in US jurisdiction)<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li
><li>International examples<ul><li>Hosting -&nbsp;<ul><li>included in recent US executive order blocking exports to Syria is language that blocks hosting, MSN Messenger, Google Chrome</li></ul
></li
><li>US mfrs export surveillance tools to other countries<ul><li>e.g. Cisco --&gt; China</li></ul
></li
><li>Pseudonym policies are not enforced equally - lots of people use pseudonyms on FB for example, but prominent activists and writers are more easily identified as using pseudonyms and are targeted for takedowns<ul><li>Spurious complaints against people can get their accounts removed, these systems are not robust</li></ul
></li></ul
></li
><li>Diaspora<ul><li>alternative platforms are possible -- alternatives to the big 3 (FB, twitter, google) that are so big they can essentially proxy for government censorship without any legal accountability (under U.S. law) (which exerts a vast influence over parallel laws in other countries)</li
><li>servers can be configured differently for different privacy needs</li
><li>explosive growth of Google+ shows that new communities can be created?<ul><li>But it may have just been a fad, growth has dropped off, we haven't seen much real change, people still spend most of their time on Facebook</li
><li>and this also has important ramifications in offline communities -- groups that self-segregate to various extents by their choice of platform will be hard to unite in a move toward accountability and transparency if that's the only thing tying them all together</li
><li>Google plus put me (Jillian) on their suggested user list! Which kind of annoyed me b/c I don't like their policies but it was useful too</li></ul
></li></ul
></li
><li>Real problem if all the big 3 platforms are American? Other countries don't have the 1st amendment --&gt; commercial operation in those countries requires the big 3 to agree to comply with the laws of those nations, but it can create thorny conflicts between corporate ethos and legal responsibility (and it's not always clear where the responsibility lies or to whom the responsibility is owed)</li
><li>Note! The First Amendment protects not only speech but "freedom of association" under U.S. law.<ul><li>In many nation-states that protect civil communication and access, there are rules that would not be Constitutional in the US -- for example, rules that limit hate speech.<ul><li>so this creates a conflict between the rights of US users and the rights of international users, which is a conundrum for platforms</li></ul
></li
><li>IP law is vastly controlled by American interests</li
><li>we think of freedom of expression (and, maybe in the future, freedom of access to knowledge/science and culture) as a human right / value, so much less vulnerable to economic arguments?</li></ul
></li
><li>In the future it will be an international law thing<ul><li>The political struggles around "internet governance" as an international issue take place to a large degree IRL and between diplomats and representatives of nation-states; it's often forward-thinking but it's usually not reported on widely</li

></li
><li>note for non-lawgeeks: the UDHR is a non-binding document, so this does not create any kind of actionable rule. it's more of a codified ethos, parts of which are accepted norms, other parts of which are less widely accepted</li

><li>In the Egypt revolution, Mubarak hit the kill switch and ironically Joe Lieberman was introducing a bill to create an internet kill switch the next day, so he was universally lampooned.<ul><li>In San Francisco they've been shutting down phone service and arresting reporters! There's a whole line of SCOTUS cases banning what the BART police are doing &gt;.&lt;</li></ul
></li
><li>Access as a right<ul><li>we can talk about free expression all day long, but if people don't have access...</li
><li>we're seeing the access debate in Brazil.</li
><li>In this country we have extraordinary privilege...</li
><li>but we do have e.g. bandwidth caps as a limit to access here</li
><li>but when you look at a country that has 1.9% internet penetration like Ethiopia, but they filter the internet, arrest bloggers anyway... the small elite who has internet access in that country is already being stifled.</li></ul
></li
><li>Question for technologists: how does the predominance of mobile technology in less developed regions affect this discussion? if we're relying on the internet *per se* then what does it mean if a huge percentage of people get their best shot at access through 4G or some other kind of technology?<ul><li>are we going to have to point our collective will at 4G as a "next step"?</li
><li>or will things like smozzy be a better place to target our support?<ul><li><a href="http://www.intomobile.com/2011/09/09/smozzys-new-android-app-offers-web-surfing-without-a-data-plan/">http://www.intomobile.com/2011/09/09/smozzys-new-android-app-offers-web-surfing-without-a-data-plan/</a></li></ul
></li
><li>or both?</li></ul
></li
><li>You come for the LOLcats but you stay for the politics<ul><li>You're blocking the internet? You're blocking my cats!</li
><li>I feel like the Internet is our chance for an end run... if we can get to a place where the internet is offering more compelling content, then what do the corporations have to offer us?</li></ul
></li
><li>Corporations can give us LOLcats now, but can they give us the next thing?<ul><li>things are funny for inexplicable reasons... the internet can provide weird stuff for us on a continuing basis, corporations will have trouble keeping up.</li></ul
></li
><li>Sealand - Data haven<ul><li>ended up not working b/c intermediaries wouldn't agree to do it</li></ul
></li
><li>Censoring porn in Tunisia - but the internet is for porn!</li
><li>Freedom of association<ul><li>social networks</li
><li>concern that I might associate myself with something that may not be popular</li></ul
></li
><li>Friend of Jillian's accused of aiding a terrorist organization for *only* talking to people on the internet - attacking communication.<ul><li>The (RECENT) U.S. Supreme Court precedent for this is Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, in case anyone is unfamiliar and wants to check it out <a href="http://goo.gl/1NJh5">http://goo.gl/1NJh5</a></li
><li>It is widely considered to be a *wrong* decision by first amendment scholars -- the "material support" in this case was expression, not $$</li></ul
></li
><li>The fact that these platforms have relatively unlimited amounts of info about you and the gov't can get this info pretty easily is a problem that needs to be addressed</li
><li>ECPA Reform is also really important -- the Electronic Communications Privacy Act has not been updated since 1986 and still controls for interception/surveillance<ul><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Communications_Privacy_Act">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Communications_Privacy_Act</a></li></ul
></li
><li>Let's say you have a social network for private things, and if you don't respond with the right cryptographic hash, that server deletes itself.<ul><li>you can create technology that is actually secure, but that's not going to come from Facebook, and I don't think it'll come from Google.</li></ul
