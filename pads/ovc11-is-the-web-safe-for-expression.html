<body>Is the Internet Safe for Free Expression?<br
/><br
/>Jillian York, Trevor Timm, Richard Esguerra - EFF Activists<br
/><br
/>Discussion of:<br
/>Technology and how it bears on freedom of expression<br
/>Law<br
/>Policy<br
/>Web censorship (domestic and international)<br
/><br
/>Pseudonyms and Social Networks<br
/><ul><li>identity policies on social networks<ul><li>lots of complex ideas converge on this issue</li
><li>identity politics<ul><li>even the basic definition of identity</li></ul
></li></ul
></li
><li>some people use pseudonyms professionally</li
><li>some people require pseudonymity/anonymity for their personal safety</li
><li>intermediaries making rules for their platforms &lt;-- the main issue underlying these problems<ul><li>the government plays a role</li
><li>private companies and their terms and policies also play a role<ul><li>censorship by private companies currently has no corresponding legal remedy</li
><li>so the gov. can pressure private internet companies to censor without overt government involvement</li></ul
></li></ul
></li
><li>when google's legal team researched whether to drop wikileaks, they reported that no laws appeared to have been broken</li
><li>but most of the intermediaries that dropped WL when controversy arose didn't do that much research and didn't reach that level of legal comprehension before they took action<br/><br
/></li
><li>Your online freedom of expression is only as strong as the weakest intermediary.<ul><li>Lots of points where your expression can be cut off --&nbsp;<ul><li>web host (can cut off your access)</li
><li>the upstream ISP for the web host&nbsp;</li
><li>the domain name system (in the form of domain name seizure)<ul><li>cuts off access unless you know the IP address<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li></ul
></li></ul
></li
><li>PIPA (formerly known as COICA)&nbsp;<ul><li>routes around jurisdictional issues that previously kept the US from seizing domain names in other countries</li
><li>instead it tells the DNS not to resolve specific domain names (so this is an effective way to cut off US access to a top level domain that isn't w/in US jurisdiction)<br/><br
/></li></ul
></li
><li>International examples<ul><li>Hosting -&nbsp;<ul><li>included in recent US executive order blocking exports to Syria is language that blocks hosting, MSN Messenger, Google Chrome</li></ul
></li
><li>US mfrs export surveillance tools to other countries<ul><li>e.g. Cisco --&gt; China</li></ul
></li
><li>Pseudonym policies are not enforced equally - lots of people use pseudonyms on FB for example, but prominent activists and writers are more easily identified as using pseudonyms and are targeted for takedowns<ul><li>Spurious complaints against people can get their accounts removed, these systems are not robust</li></ul
></li></ul
></li
><li>Diaspora<ul><li>alternative platforms are possible -- alternatives to the big 3 (FB, twitter, google) that are so big they can essentially proxy for government censorship without any legal accountability (under U.S. law) (which exerts a vast influence over parallel laws in other countries)</li
><li>servers can be configured differently for different privacy needs</li
><li>explosive growth of Google+ shows that new communities can be created?<ul><li>But it may have just been a fad, growth has dropped off, we haven't seen much real change, people still spend most of their time on Facebook</li
><li>and this also has important ramifications in offline communities -- groups that self-segregate to various extents by their choice of platform will be hard to unite in a move toward accountability and transparency if that's the only thing tying them all together</li
><li>Google plus put me (Jillian) on their suggested user list! Which kind of annoyed me b/c I don't like their policies but it was useful too</li
