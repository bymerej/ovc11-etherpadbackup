Exercise
Compensation models on open online creation. Things that should happen? Directions that we can go in. It could be a catch phrase like : I'm part of an organization that has a music player how can we make money out of this. Or I'm a youtube content creator. Reflect in directions that this type of work can go in...

What are the dream scenarios or use cases for donations and micropayments?

What needs to exist?  What needs to get better?

Break into groups: 3 ppl per group.  Here's what groups came up with:

[paste your notes here when done]

Monetizing the web

Cover charge vs. Tipjar

Paywalls might be a failure, while tipjar seems better?

Other ways to monetize the web: everything is a service, give away the content.

Build commuinity access to community, sell an acess fee for the community.  


Bitcoin, what's standing in the way of mass adoption of Bitcoin? #1 security #2 liquidity (ease of buying, aka as easy as buying coffee) #3 currency risk

Super Group Nr 1

- How to flattr a youtube video? Should the uploader get the flattr or the original content author?

- How to finance music artists? Donations + concert tickets?
The big problem is make people pay. The only way is either creating a exchange culture, without expecting a reward inmediately. 

That's the reason behind flattr. To provoke this change to happen. 
Kickstarter model is much more effective for these reasons. 
Is the kickstarter model, could we implemented in other ways? Its an unsustainable model (kickstarter). 
 Its hard to count on people on donation. Doesn't mean that it will be the way of getting the most amount. 
 
 It get to a interesting paradox, social 
 
 the audience creates for free and watch for free. that's working well. Flattr makes it interesting. Where as the other model is not compatible with the phenomenon. 
 
 Curious in virtual goods role?  How to marry the behavior between virtual goods and quality creative goods? 
 

People pay for "stupid stuff" :) online just for fun!  So why don't they pay for content.

Add game mechanics or points to Flattr, or other donation systems.

If the creator could know and customize their site for somebody who had donated.  (But that's a kind of paywall)

Kickstarter has been really successful with the prizes.

It's okay to have different levels of return from the creator, it's positive, not necessarily negative the way a paywall might be

Flattr is like busking(sp?) which we see in NYC all the time.  Talking to folks who live off that and learning about how it functions might be a good approach. 

Maybe we're thinking too narrowly about it, could be donations of resources (studio space)

Farmville duck sales vs. washington post print edition sales?

Micropayments should be clickable (ease). I need to set up, it should be easier than that.

Wjhy people think that virtual goods are valuable? 

I believe that Flattr hacks that economic system that we work right now, by creating a model that it could be applied to any currency, either trade system as well as real currency (even bitcoins). Rather than standarizing another currency that sins for its same flaws.


- How to finance movie makers? Donations + movie tickets.

- Donations, paywalls, ads, is there a 4th way to make a living? Communism? ;)

Introduction to flattr - video

- It would be great to have flattr accept bitcoin. 
Everyone in flattr has their own opinion. We don't accept bitcoin because of the legal implications.

(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ Group
- how to get people use to any type of micropayment system? donation driven in particular.

it's gotta be easy.

the social part of kickstartr is you know what you're getting, there's the prize.  that's like the virtual good that you pay for.  This is a big key.

Donations were really important to an open source project with a huge server.  When they made their bandwidth use and costs transparent, people would always donate enough to ensure survival.  Transparency is key.

Like a feature request list.

Users know what they're paying for and know what they're getting.


- Bitcoin usibility? bitcoin only perks to create liquidity.

Example: stuff/services you can only buy/use with bitcoin

- Bitcoin's second generation software to improve UI/Ux.

Bitcoin development community really focusing on usability now. 

- a method to obtain Bitcoin without mining or buying with USD.

And if you can buy the things you need with bitcoin, there's less currency risk.

How do you make it possible for anybody to get access to Bitcoin.  The focus has been on people who already are users, but it should be on everyone who isn't already a user.

BRAINSTORM THINGS WE NEED (Arin, Tom, Jake, Celeste, Chana, Shakir)

Easy to use to use tool kit for creators in one place.

A way to sustain ones self producing their own work.
A funding effort that can scale.
Financial solution that doesn't require philanthropy
Solutions that supports the artist.

Proceeds needs to match what it costs to make the work.
Sponsors need to have to pony up more money.
Over throw iTunes and cut out the middle man.
A shift in culture, encourage people to want to pay.
A ecosystem of creation and consuming that works in harmony.

Distribution tools to measure audience demand and get indie films theaters

Aligning the producers utopia with the audiences utopia
Barter!
Move away from the abstract attempt at decimal point representation of value.
We need a fundamental new understanding of what value is, how it's exchanged and the organizational intelligence that is exists when transactions retain value into the future.
