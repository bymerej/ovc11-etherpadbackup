Exercise
Compensation models on open online creation. Things that should happen? Directions that we can go in. It could be a catch phrase like : I'm part of an organization that has a music player how can we make money out of this. Or I'm a youtube content creator. Reflect in directions that this type of work can go in...

What are the dream scenarios or use cases for donations and micropayments?

What needs to exist?  What needs to get better?

Break into groups: 3 ppl per group.  Here's what groups came up with:

[paste your notes here when done]

Monetizing the web

Cover charge vs. Tipjar

Paywalls might be a failure, while tipjar seems better?

Other ways to monetize the web: everything is a service, give away the content.

Build commuinity access to community, sell an acess fee for the community.  


Bitcoin, what's standing in the way of mass adoption of Bitcoin? #1 security #2 liquidity (ease of buying, aka as easy as buying coffee) #3 currency risk

Super Group Nr 1

- How to flattr a youtube video? Should the uploader get the flattr or the original content author?

- How to finance music artists? Donations + concert tickets?
The big problem is make people pay. The only way is either creating a exchange culture, without expecting a reward inmediately. 

That's the reason behind flattr. To provoke this change to happen. 
Kickstarter model is much more effective for these reasons. 
Is the kickstarter model, could we implemented in other ways? Its an unsustainable model (kickstarter). 
 Its hard to count on people on donation. Doesn't mean that it will be the way of getting the most amount. 
 
 It get to a interesting paradox, social 
 
 the audience creates for free and watch for free. that's working well. F


- How to finance movie makers? Donations + movie tickets.

- Donations, paywalls, ads, is there a 4th way to make a living? Communism? ;)

Introduction to flattr - video

- It would be great to have flattr accept bitcoin. 
Everyone in flattr has their own opinion. We don't accept bitcoin because of the legal implications.

(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ Group
- how to get people use to any type of micropayment system? donation.

- Bitcoin usibility? bitcoin only perks to create liquidity.

- Bitcoin's second generation software to improve UI/Ux.

- a method to obtain Bitcoin without mining or buying with USD.
