Is the Internet Safe for Free Expression?

Jillian York, Trevor Timm, Richard Esguerra - EFF Activists

Discussion of:
Technology and how it bears on freedom of expression
Law
Policy
Web censorship (domestic and international)

Pseudonyms and Social Networks
 * identity policies on social networks
   * lots of complex ideas converge on this issue
   * identity politics
     * even the basic definition of identity
 * some people use pseudonyms professionally
 * some people require pseudonymity/anonymity for their personal safety
 * intermediaries making rules for their platforms <-- the main issue underlying these problems
   * the government plays a role
   * private companies and their terms and policies also play a role
     * censorship by private companies currently has no corresponding legal remedy
     * so the gov. can pressure private internet companies to censor without overt government involvement
