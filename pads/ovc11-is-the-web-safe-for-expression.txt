Is the Internet Safe for Free Expression?

Jillian York, Trevor Timm, Richard Esguerra - EFF Activists

Discussion of:
Technology and how it bears on freedom of expression
Law
Policy
Web censorship (domestic and international)

Pseudonyms and Social Networks
 * identity policies on social networks
   * lots of complex ideas converge on this issue
   * identity politics
     * even the basic definition of identity
 * some people use pseudonyms professionally
 * some people require pseudonymity/anonymity for their personal safety
 * intermediaries making rules for their platforms <-- the main issue underlying these problems
   * the government plays a role
   * private companies and their terms and policies also play a role
     * censorship by private companies currently has no corresponding legal remedy
     * so the gov. can pressure private internet companies to censor without overt government involvement
 * when google's legal team researched whether to drop wikileaks, they reported that no laws appeared to have been broken
 * but most of the intermediaries that dropped WL when controversy arose didn't do that much research and didn't reach that level of legal comprehension before they took action

 * Your online freedom of expression is only as strong as the weakest intermediary.
   * Lots of points where your expression can be cut off -- 
     * web host (can cut off your access)
     * the upstream ISP for the web host 
     * the domain name system (in the form of domain name seizure)
       * cuts off access unless you know the IP address

 * PIPA (formerly known as COICA) 
   * routes around jurisdictional issues that previously kept the US from seizing domain names in other countries
   * instead it tells the DNS not to resolve specific domain names (so this is an effective way to cut off US access to a top level domain that isn't w/in US jurisdiction)

 * International examples
   * Hosting - 
     * included in recent US executive order blocking exports to Syria is language that blocks hosting, MSN Messenger, Google Chrome
   * US mfrs export surveillance tools to other countries
     * e.g. Cisco --> China
   * Pseudonym policies are not enforced equally - lots of people use pseudonyms on FB for example, but prominent activists and writers are more easily identified as using pseudonyms and are targeted for takedowns
     * Spurious complaints against people can get their accounts removed, these systems are not robust
 * Diaspora
   * alternative platforms are possible -- alternatives to the big 3 (FB, twitter, google) that are so big they can essentially proxy for government censorship without any legal accountability (under U.S. law) (which exerts a vast influence over parallel laws in other countries)

   * servers can be configured differently for different privacy needs
   * explosive growth of Google+ shows that new communities can be created?
     * But it may have just been a fad, growth has dropped off, we haven't seen much real change, people still spend most of their time 
     *
