This are my thoughts that have come from a number of opportunities talking about this topic: the courses Video and the Open Web at NYU's ITP program, Social Activism using Mobile Technology, conversations with Ben Moskowitz, Becky Kazansky, and Elisa Kreisinger. 

Thesis: Viral moments and memes like Rebecca Black's Friday demonstrate that there is a vocal contigent on the net whose comments and media look to mock and bully netizens based on gender, sexuality or race. What can the Open Video community do to change this contentious and charged conversation and improve the space for expression? 


Why does this matter?

Open Video is a movement to promote free expression and innovation in online video through open standards, open source, and sharing.

(2) contextualize this example with other historical analogs of misogyny in media and illustrating the gender double standard (through another semi-viral moment A. Samuels "livin the life")

I love lucy (studio360)
 i love lucy. an interesting part:

Emily Nussbaum: But then she was always tamped back into her place. The nature of that humiliation in each episode is part of what I found really unnerving about it as a child.
Emily Nussbaum grew up to write about TV for New York Magazine.  She still doesn’t love Lucy.
Nussbaum: I do reject that absolute insistence on seeing her as a provocative force for freedom. She shrieks and wheedles and whines and she’s heightened in this way. And then she gets spanked and humiliated
KA: She refused to be a stepford wife and instead is like a child.
Nussbaum:  Right. But I didn't laugh when that happened. It wasn’t funny to me.
Barreca: Lucy was always about desire and the idea that she wasn't trying to figure out what other people wanted.  She wanted to do what she wanted to do. That's a seditious act. That's seditious for anyone in the 50s, but especially for a woman.
Nussbaum: this desire for attention is totally detached from any desire to practice singing or dancing or anything like that. 
Barreca: It's not I Respect Lucy, who would watch that?
Nussbaum: That's the joke of the show, is that Lucille Ball is a talented comedian but that Lucy Ricardo is a completely untalented hack who is just a ball of need. That part does seem very modern because people always there's this big cultural thing right now where young girls are just constantly attacked for wanting to be famous for being famous as if this was created by the internet. But actually, when you watch the show, one of the things you see is, in the case of Lucy Ricardo, she wants to be famous and Hollywood glamorous for ways that are really part of the larger continuum with Paris Hilton. She wants to be famous for being Lucy.
