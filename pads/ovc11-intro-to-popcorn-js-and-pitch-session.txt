"popcorn is not a magic wand"
it is a framework , that will give you tools to build

Today, we're going to see how the code works...

Over 1200 Tests to back up every release

Popcorn.js
    > is really easy to learn 
    > is really easy to code


Popcorm.js's Story 
with a video
do something
(at some time) 
(with some information)

What about the HTML5 Video API?

Methods like play(), pause()
... are still play(), pause()
Properties like ... (missing - woops) 

Never extend the native. 
Always return a popcorn object

(becoming evangenalistic - "I don't need Flash for this!")

Demo'ing early version of Popcorn Maker

info: https://wiki.mozilla.org/PopcornMaker

Very intuitive interface 
Drag--and-drop adding footnotes
Then, just export the code and have a page ready 
Can save or export as html or ProjectJSON
"transfer the server and be done"

Showing a particular example not using HTML5 particularly / using SoundCloud, Google StreetView

BM:
A lot of the operations are theoretical at the moment

- The most polished use right now will be out next month ... One Millionth Tower

Q + A

Q: What about web sockets?
A: An example of Socket IO / mentioned an example from the JSConf http://2011.jsconf.us/

A: Popcorn itself is infintely flexible. The examples we have are limited, but if you're a developer -- whatever you would like to see / might be in development 

next generation:
- composite real time information into a movie


BM gives an example
