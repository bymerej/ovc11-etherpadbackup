Lifecyle of open source editors: 
http://pitivi.org/i/history.png

A good reason to not start a new video editor.

What are the dependency for pitivi

Topics for discussion:
* collaborative  video editing
* open video standards 

* open document format for video production
* hardware acceleration
* Kronos http://www.khronos.org/opengl
* Scripted interactions
* Web interfaces and interchange formats. 

Shared format
* Open documented format adoption ( a very successful ) 
* What about FinalCutPro XML
* FinalCutPro X makes it even harder to exchange formats. 
* Pitivi XML format is ~pretty human~ readable. 
* Walking through a sample Pitivi xml file

Pitivi overview: 
* Gstreamer based (widely supported) 
* Gstreamer does not have an intermediate format. 
* Disadvantage of intermediate format not all formats are seekable and work well in video editors. 
* showing clip editing. 
* effects do not yet have key framing. 
* New "Gstreamer Editing Services" core coming in with improved performance
** (helps address the intermediate codec issues) 

Color space issues (camera codecs locked up) 
* gstreamer full support for 4:4:4 color space representation. 
* auto color correction undone by video editors like final cut.
* Final cut pro has filters for camaras to normalize video content. 
* without intermediate format hard to do this in realtime.

to bring forward to OVA as project - ernest [at] openvideoalliance.org - if there is a possibility to create a consortium for open video editor standards (see open document standart) - but also check what happens lightworks

set up a mailinglist for FLOSS video editors
set up a FLOSS video editors page @ open video alliance [issues page], or within one of the following pages?:
