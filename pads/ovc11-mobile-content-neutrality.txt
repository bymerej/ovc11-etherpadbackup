Introduction

policy and technology progressing together
wireless carriers - how much can they do with the netorks they control?
what role do we serve in compelling these carriers to open up the networks to allow different services?

Current State of Policies
practices of mobile carriers in low income communities blocking access - translating into the video space 
January - cheapest plans not allowing access = clear content discrimination 

Net neutrality - uncertainty in the mobile space / how this will be affected [too much authority to make decisions without enough oversight] 
wireline vs. wireless carriers - different rules applied 

David Carter - Metro PCS
calls routed to place in rural Iowa - could call into telephone numbers to listen to radio news channels around the world [getting news directly from the source] 
PCS began to see high volumes of traffic going to these numbers [increase volumes = moving telephone number into a blocked pattern] 
- value of your unlimited long distance plan decreases if this is type of access you want 
- Dist of Maryland Judge - wireless carrier be able to set pricing plans any way they wanted; asked Judge to go to FCC - REFUSED to even ask FCC to look at issue and analyze if this was a legal issue with the calling-block datat plan structure
 [client made decision to pursue issue in Fed Dist court...blocking had just began to occur so wanted to receive a temporary injunction - and in FCC land may not be able to get this sort of fast paced injunctive relief 
Carriers often effective and receive deference for the actions they are taking 
in order to overcome challenges [content of video/app/phone call] - you should be able to access any lawful content through any device. NOT the carriers place to pick and choose the winners. 

COMMON CARRIER OBLIGATIONS
- anti discrimination principles that should be applied more broadly and clearly
- FCC implementing net neturality in different way depending if its wireless or wireline is a poor policy choice
- mergers = could be left with two carriers controlling entire wireless industry 
[e.g. google - motorola...every time see consolidation in this industry takes away from consumer freedom]
                what is the business incentive after these mergers happen? 
                do you even know if a delay is happening....human behavior = will just go to the     content that is easier to access w/o knowing these netowkr management practices are happen
                
- applying these policies based on idea of competition - which assume need less regulation 
- i.e. text message blocking and campaigns [carriers make it cost prohibitive and time consuming, but this is most popular way to communicate in the US] 

e.g. exempting own video service from its caps 

Filing Cases under the Net Neutrality Principles 
- loking for courts that are hospitable / but then will see circuit splits? Will happen as rules come into effect
- FCC trying to walk delicate line b/c big pushpack from carriers having Title II common carrier obligations [concerns on what Conrgess would do if went in that direction] - this would have been the clearer path to get there 
- will these current rules be upheld?

Wiki/Video Montage Project - Amanda, MICC
- MICC: nonprofit texting company, wanted to make sure originally not getting blocked as a small business; last January born! Had to fiogure out how to come out with protocols appropriately;riginal purpose around basic consumer fairness -
how technologies can do social good through different mediums 
- Asked by Commissioner to collect stories on the lack of innovation [we don't have enough to say how this is hurting anything yet] - want to collect stories on what people are afraid of what the mobile industry is doing. People scared if breaking laws because of their mobile activity. 
- Wahington - ust not getting enough iormation and working within the bureaucratic structure 

in order to empower decision/policy molving issues on national level - need to get the collective together; they can tell their stories. CHALLENGE is building the critical mass to explain what is happening. 

What If Generator 
- wiki generating online "what if" paths if we had [i.e. open internet access to wireless networks]
-Services exist but NOT in a wide scale - i.e. CPU for animation - could rent more powerful machines, but impossible because of uploading issues 
- designers and innovatorsscrepancy between downloadand upload speeds 
- Open Access - why is this NOT the attractive models? 

Additional Approaches to Addressing Issue - Nick 
NSA - became involved in huge lawsuit against FBI. lasted 8 years 
organizations supporting lawsuit were more from literary, publishing, academic world rather than telecom world 
lawsuit filed under "John Doe" = monk like existence 
telecom service focused on privacy and the rights of consumers [CALYX] 
Aug 2010 - partially released from gag order 

Originally - focused on privacy and right to anonymity
now - network neutrality and other issues coming into the mix 
- many gray areas in the law that have become much more apparent post Sept 11 Patriot Act and other legislation [wants to test this in terms of their consitutionality] 
Calyx will BE a telecommunications provider = VoIP, voice over service, CLEC 

nonprofit route - profit mode was one of the main reasons big carriers NOT doing anything in this sphere 
1. didnt want to make enemies within govt - do lots of gov't K work / lucrative 
2. will come before regulatory bodies and don't want to risk not having favorable attention
 [public relations - want to stay neutral b/c people on both sides who disagree]
 
 Grassroots movement 
 
 Non Neutral Conduct App - Phillip 
- DivPro - detects when a service is being degraded 
Phil wants App that goes even further / but also what is the feasibility of this solution
technology in lace since how Comcast got caught
- Rob P. kept trynig to upload DNS that would not upload, so then trying to download other public domainstuff - discovered blockage 
- are you getting speed that's advertised? - no tool yet to know if wired ISP is blocking or degrading; just are you getting advertsided speed = need to discover for yourself
- AT&T blocking skype...was pretty obvious 
Berkman Center - means to promote online censorship Herdict] 
- how activits track whats blocked in repressive regimes [firewall] 

BROAD principle rules - for when they go into effect
only way we will know what net neutrality means on practical level is by establishing series of new precedent of what these principles really stand for - so means some period of time with test cases 
- area of law in which FCC will have any stat jurisdicitonal time limit in whcih to act
- FCC is famous for making NO decision [petitions that have been epnding for 10+ year] so concern is that if we don't organize people and give them tools to understand when there are violations, we will never have teeth going into these principles for enforcement purposes
