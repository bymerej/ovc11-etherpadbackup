Introduction

policy and technology progressing together
wireless carriers - how much can they do with the netorks they control?
what role do we serve in compelling these carriers to open up the networks to allow different services?

Current State of Policies
practices of mobile carriers in low income communities blocking access - translating into the video space 
January - cheapest plans not allowing access = clear content discrimination 

Net neutrality - uncertainty in the mobile space / how this will be affected [too much authority to make decisions without enough oversight] 
wireline vs. wireless carriers - different rules applied 

David Carter - Metro PCS
calls routed to place in rural Iowa - could call into telephone numbers to listen to radio news channels around the world [getting news directly from the source] 
PCS began to see high volumes of traffic going to these numbers [increase volumes = moving telephone number into a blocked pattern] 
- value of your unlimited long distance plan decreases if this is type of access you want 
- Dist of Maryland Judge - wireless carrier be able to set pricing plans any way they wanted; asked Judge to go to FCC - REFUSED to even ask FCC to look at issue and analyze if this was a legal issue with the calling-block datat plan structure
 [client made decision to pursue issue in Fed Dist court...blocking had just began to occur so wanted to receive a temporary injunction - and in FCC land may not be able to get this sort of fast paced injunctive relief 
Carriers often effective and receive deference for the actions they are taking 
in order to overcome challenges [content of video/app/phone call] - you should be able to access any lawful content through any device. NOT the carriers place to pick and choose the winners. 

COMMON CARRIER OBLIGATIONS
- anti discrimination principles that should be applied more broadly and clearly
- FCC implementing net neturality in different way depending if its wireless or wireline is a poor policy choice
- mergers = could be left with two carriers controlling entire wireless industry 
[e.g. google - motorola...every time see consolidation in this industry takes away from consumer freedom]
                what is the business incentive after these mergers happen? 
                do you even know if a delay is happening....human behavior = will just go to the     content that is easier to access w/o knowing these netowkr management practices are happen
                
- applying these policies based on idea of competition - which assume need less regulation 
- i.e. text message blocking and campaigns [carriers make it cost prohibitive and time consuming, but this is most popular way to communicate in the US] 

e.g. exempting own video service from its caps 

Filing Cases under the Net Neutrality Principles 
- loking for courts that are hospitable / but then will see circuit splits? Will happen as rules come into effect
- FCC trying to walk delicate line b/c big pushpack from carriers having Title II common carrier obligations [concerns on what Conrgess would do if went in that direction] - this would have been the clearer path to get there 
- will these current rules be upheld?

Wiki/Video Montage Project - Amanda, MICC
- MICC: nonprofit texting company, wanted to make sure originally not getting blocked as a small business; last January born! Had to fiogure out how to come out with protocols appropriately;riginal purpose around basic consumer fairness -
how technologies can do social good through different mediums 
- Asked by Commissioner to collect stories on the lack of innovation [we don't have enough to say how this is hurting anything yet] - want to collect stories on what people are afraid of what the mobile industry is doing. People scared if breaking laws because of their mobile activity. 
- Wahington - ust not getting enough iormation and working within the bureaucratic structure 

in order to empower decision/policy molving issues on national level - need to get the collective together; they can tell their stories. CHALLENGE is building the critical mass to explain what is happening. 

What If Generator 
- wiki generating online "what if" paths if we had [i.e. open internet access to wireless networks]
-Services exist but NOT in a wide scale - i.e. CPU for animation - could rent more powerful machines, but impossible because of uploading issues 
- designers and innovatorsscrepancy between downloadand upload speeds 
- Open Access - why is this NOT the attractive models? 

Additional Approaches to Addressing Issue - Nick 
NSA - became involved in huge lawsuit against FBI. lasted 8 years 
organizations supporting lawsuit were more from literary, publishing, academic world rather than telecom world 
lawsuit filed under "John Doe" = monk like existence 
telecom service focused on privacy
