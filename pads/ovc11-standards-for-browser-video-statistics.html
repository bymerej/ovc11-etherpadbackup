<body>== Standards for Browser Video Playback Metrics<br
/><br
/>Zachary Ozer (JWPlayer)<br
/>Pablo Schklowsky (JWPlayer)<br
/><br
/>* start off with demo of Flash with adaptive bitrate switching and metrics<br
/>&nbsp; * shows bandwidth<br
/>&nbsp; * shows size of video (width x height)<br
/>&nbsp; * shows dropped frames<br
/>&nbsp; * shows switching between different levels<br
/>* there is no way to do this in HTML5 right now<br
/><br
/>Use cases:<br
/>* gathering engagement data<br
/>* adaptive bitrate switching<br
/>* playback quality monitoring &amp; dropped frames<br
/>* network congestion monitoring &amp; devices in specific areas<br
/><br
/>What metrics/statistics have the frameworks implemented:<br
/>* Zach shows a table with the existing proprties as fimplemented by Firefox and Chrome, as well as the existing proposal and what other frameworks implement (Silverlight, Flash etc)<br
/>* current proposal:<br
/>&nbsp; * bytesReceived<br
/>&nbsp; * bytesDecoded<br
/>&nbsp; * decodedFrames<br
/>&nbsp; * droppedFrames<br
/>&nbsp; * presentedFrames<br
/>&nbsp; * playbackJitter<br
/>* are these good metrics? what else do we need?<br
/><br
/>Discussion:<br
/>* frames per second is a bad metric - what does it give you? maybe something like percentage of frames not displayed would be better? maybe measuring the accumulated time that a clock has been stopped/delayed?<br
/>* there is an optimal playback quality; a counter that accumulates the lateness of frames can help, but then you cannot catch up with changes; you either need to define a window or be able to reset the counter to do useful measurements<br
/>* you want to be able to separate out whe<br
