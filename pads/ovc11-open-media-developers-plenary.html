/><br
/>Separation of "technology" and "open media developer" tracks<br
/><br
/>Other discussion ideas<br
/><br
/>* Web Audio API - competing proposals<br
/><br
/>* Streaming server implementations - Luca, Thomas<br
/><br
/>* Media Stream API proposal - browser people should talk about that in the device api session, maybe follow up on monday<br
/><br
/>* Content protection in HTML5<br
/><br
/>* Playlists, APIs among players and browsers. Multiple clips with seamless transition - maybe talk about in the flash vs html5 panel?<br
/><br
/>* Alpha channel in HTML5 video? - will talk about that in webm context<br
/><br
/>* How to loop HTML5 video. Browser bug? Too slow? Doesn't work in Mozilla and Chrome at least. Not seamless.<br
/><br
/>* Positional/3D audio? Possible with Apple's Web Audio api proposal<br
/><br
/>Encourage pair programming to fix specific issues in the session.&nbsp;<br
