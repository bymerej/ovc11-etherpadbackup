SecureSmartCam: Nathan explains progress on the SecureSmartCam project.

See this blog post explaining progress since conceptualization at OVC 2010:

https://guardianproject.info/2011/09/10/progress-on-mobile-video-privacy-tools/

Examples of usage on the ObscuraCam facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/obscuracam

Including this video demo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXOKRShqYa0&feature=player_embedded 

Facial recognition in this functionality could also be used not only redact, but also to embed additional data (eg. intent/consent)

Points to other examples:
- Opencv face detection (check out videos illustrating usage - youtube opencv)
- Viewdle (Facial Recognition API) iOS SDK including comic Napoleon explaining...

There's the 'visual detection' side of the house, and the 'data' side - both parts of SSC.

Rich Jones -- OpenWatch
 * Features
   * iphone & Android apps, records audio/video then gives option to upload to openwatch site, openwatch redacts by listening sensitive personally information (i.e. Social Security #s)
   * i.e. citizen refuses DUI in San Diego -- http://openwatch.net/view/3543
     * lead to investigation by state of CA
   * Also a voice Dropbox, user dials phone # and records and submits to site
 * Use cases
   * Responding to a request to start using in Jamaica
   * Activist in Chile used Synogen Mod to load the app based on ??swipe pattern??

 * LectureLeaks
   * allows students to upload college lectures

Philosophy = We are all under surveillance anyway, the public needs to derive benefit

What about security?
 * OpenWatch app designed for simplicity. Adding layers of security adds layers of usability complication.

Other technology examples
 * yelp type app that uses security cameras to show what a scene looks like in real-time at a restaurant or commercial establishment
 * Berkerley Open Courseware video software that keeps professor from getting in the way of whiteboard by referencing earlier frames and tracking professor


IDEAS
    * TemporalTagAutoSmooshVideo
    * Google Earth Sat XVerify
    * Auto-untagger
    *Option to redact when someone tags you
    *Gamification of anonymization/redaction
    * Layers of access, multiple sources, ACL
    * VOICE manipulator
    
Sarah Knuckey: potential challenges thinking from human rights documentation perspective
 * - Perpetrators removing selves 
 * - Victims (in future need for identification or proof) 
   * [possible to have reverse redaction that decrypts redaction back to original]
   * use a key that a trusted source has/ + public key
 * - In mass situations/Crowd situations
 * - Does it really hide people?
 * - Voice distortion 
   * (Guardian sees this as important, wants to implement)

OpenCV allows "standards of redaction" to be identified

Nathan: On the decisions about putting something into the 'app' world; do you put it in the store or curate it/distribute it specifically? In app store, ObscuraCam is how you hide in keg parties. But if it was just for human right use, it would flag the users.

For evidentiary value: it's important to have reversible redaction, alongside signing of original value. Or could it be just a redaction of a part of the video, sustaining the evidentiary value of the other parts of the video.

Harlo: images have the visual data that we're used to understanding in the image (the image we see) + the data we don't see. Two sides to it.

Use scenario of obscura cam technology doesn't have to be for everyone, even if it's a small percentage it's an extremely valuable minority who needs to use it

Importance of cultural paradigms - around intent (of the creator), consent (of the subjects), anonymity, implications of sharing an image - may be greater than the actual tool itself. 

Case in Afghanistan involving Physicians for Human Rights who discovered moving of mass graves, the discovery of the grave removal was used by satellite, but launched by human anectdotes, not pure scientific evidence at first.
