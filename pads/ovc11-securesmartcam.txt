See this blog post explaining progress since conceptualization at OVC 2010:

Examples of usage on the ObscuraCam facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/obscuracam

Including this video demo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXOKRShqYa0&feature=player_embedded 

Facial recognition in this functionality could also be used not only redact, but also to embed additional data (eg. intent/consent)

Points to other examples:
- Opencv face detection (check out videos illustrating usage - youtube opencv)
- Viewdle (Facial Recognition API) iOS SDK including comic Napoleon explaining...

There's the 'visual detection' side of the house, and the 'data' side - both parts of SSC.

Rich Jones -- OpenWatch
 * Features
   * iphone & Android apps, records audio/video then gives option to upload to openwatch site, openwatch redacts by listening sensitive personally information (i.e. Social Security #s)

     * lead to investigation by state of CA
   * Also a voice Dropbox, user dials phone # and records and submits to site
 * Use cases
   * Responding to a request to start using in Jamaica
   * Activist in Chile used Synogen Mod to load the app based on ??swipe pattern??

Philosophy = We are all under surveillance anyway, the public needs to derive benefit

What about security?
 * OpenWatch app designed for simplicity. Adding layers of security adds layers of usability complication.

Other technology examples
 * yelp type app that uses security cameras to show what a scene looks like in real-time at a restaurant or commercial establishment
 * Berkerley Open Courseware video software that keeps professor from getting in the way of whiteboard by referencing earlier frames and tracking professor
