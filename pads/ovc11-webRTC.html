/><br
/>== Introduction - what is WebRTC<br
/><br
/>Slides: <a href="https://docs.google.com/present/edit?id=0AbRZ9Ue-MGwtZGhyNDc1cTdfMWZkNmc3dGQ0&hl=en_US">https://docs.google.com/present/edit?id=0AbRZ9Ue-MGwtZGhyNDc1cTdfMWZkNmc3dGQ0&amp;hl=en_US</a><br
/><br
/>* real-time communication for the Web: need for open and free solutions<br
/>* make it easy for any Web developer to easily deploy RTC apps<br
/>* Requirements:<br
/>&nbsp; * open<br
/>&nbsp; * high quality<br
/>&nbsp; * low latency<br
/>&nbsp; * secure<br
/>&nbsp; * interoperable<br
/>&nbsp; * ease of use<br
/><br
/>* What will it be used for?<br
/>&nbsp; * phone app<br
/>&nbsp; * video conferencing<br
/>&nbsp; * do what flash is capable of and more<br
/><br
/>== How did we get where we are<br
/><br
/>* started a year ago over lunch, IETF meeting July 2010<br
/>* requirements have been there for many years<br
/>* this is the right time to address it<br
/>* IETF RTCWEB WB formed in April 2011: focus on network protocols<br
/>* W3C WebRT WG created May&nbsp; 2011: JS API focus<br
/>* focus on WHATWG specification<br
/><br
/>== Implementation<br
/><br
/>* standards and implementations need to go at the same pace<br
/>* open source project developed that Chrome, Firefox &amp; Opera etc can pick up<br
/>* PeerConnection in Webkit and Chrome Sept 2011 (demo provided)<br
/>* PeerConnection API in Firefox Q1 2012 (ikran) (demo provided)<br
/>* CISCO open sourced SIP stack (SIP proxy server to signal to real phone)<br
/>* CISCO demos shows a Firefox plugin that implements the SIP stack<br
/>* Ericsson has a Webkit implementation that uses WebRTC<br
/><br
/>== What does the platform provide?<br
/><br
/>* media capture<br
/>* real-time media encoding<br
/>* signal processing (noise filter, echo cancellation, gain control etc)<br
/>* real-time secure media transmission (RTP distribution, low latency, jitter buffer, encrypotion etc)<br
/>* P2P data channel should be included<br
/>* how to do signalling / negotiation<br
/><br
/><br
/><br
/>DISCUSSION<br
/><br
/>* SIP - implementation in the browser necessary? is it possibl to do peer2peer SIP without a SIP server? SIP requires a registrar<br
/>* call recording (real-time processing required, remote machine recording, where to compress, saving to local file)<br
/>* p2p distribution of content?<br
/>* DDOS? protocol to provide a shard secret and IP address is used called ICE; rate-limit the ICE protocol (there will be a native implementation of ICE)<br
/>* what protocols are supported? SRTP/RTP, DTLS (key exchange), RTCP, TURN server for two NAT-ed peers, SDP-based codec negotiation will exist<br
/>* codecs? trying to mandate vp8 &amp; opus (2.5-20ms latency codec); real-time transcoding isn't going to happen so how do we get&nbsp;<br
/>* what apis to expose for statistics? round-trip time, packet loss, latency, delay<br
/>* retain connection when switching networks/ IP addresses? not sure it works<br
/>* SIP signalling gateways exist in telephone providers<br
/>* codec transcoding gateways are not something that people want to implement<br
/>* applications: screen sharing, e.g. a live video editing session, real-time file sharing (e.g. experience video/audio together)<br
/>* cross-origin permission restrictions of what one is able to do with the data? ICE channel gives you the trust and your peer can do what they want; depending on the key exchange mechanism, you can ascertain that they are still who they claim they were at the beginning of the connection<br
/>* are schemes like ZRTP supported? not right now; don't have secure conversation through an untrusted website!<br
/>* have all the browsers implement Kademlia?<br
/>* isn't the WebRTC stack over-engineered? is there a slim version of WebRTC? e.g. for Web server content that connects to non-browser UAs like vlc; you should support codecs and probably SIP if you don't want to support JavaScript<br
/>* WebRTC and mobile? can VP8 run on phones? wait for HW implementations.<br
/>* chrome on mobile and WebRTC? right now phone users use apps more than the browser; in future it will be both and increasingly browsers<br
/>* what's still missing? requirements document - spec is still unstable; API is very basic only and goes barely beyond establishing a connection; network side of things is quite complete though what parts we want to support and which don't is still under discussion<br
/>&nbsp; * mediaStream API needs more&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp; * device handling e.g. how do you enumerate cameras<br
/>&nbsp; * error reporting e.g. if TURN server doesn't exist<br
/>&nbsp; * metrics<br
/>&nbsp; * signalling<br
/>&nbsp; * use cases<br
/>* is there a p2p websocket API? media goes over RTP and thus over UDP and is unreliable; do we build a reliable channel over this or do we leave it to the Web developer; is it possible to do this via Web sockets?<br
/>* are there going to be implemeter prescriptions for the protocols?<br
/><br
/><br
/>Outcome:<br
/>Create a break-out group to discuss use cases, signalling needs, metrics needs, error reporting needs for the mediaStream API<br
