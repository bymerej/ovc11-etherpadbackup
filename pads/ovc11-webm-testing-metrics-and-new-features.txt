Discussion:

  * what features should be added?
  * what challenges are not yet being addressed?
  
  * Could the WebM project be run better?
    * How can the community become more involved?
    * How do we go about developing the next free video codec?


* WebM team says they are still learning how to run a community project.
* There should be more sharing of what the team members are working on with the community.
* Lots of communication is happening in video conferences. Maybe it should be moved to a hang-out.
* Issue tracker on code.google.com is public. Working with the community through the bug tracker can be really productive.
