Potential topics:

 * WebVTT syntax ‒ anything missing that we should add in a hurry?
 * Style and rendering ‒ is it any good? Overkill to support multiple tracks natively?
 * UI ‒ standardized icons for indicating availability? [CC] icon?
 * Chapters ‒ should the end point be significant?
 * Transcript ‒ can it be built into browsers in a sane way?
 * UI for enabling multiple tracks?
 * Descriptions ‒ synthesis?
