Potential topics:

 * WebVTT syntax ‒ anything missing that we should add in a hurry?
 * WebVTT Style and rendering ‒ is it any good? Overkill to support multiple tracks natively?
 * <track> UI ‒ standardized icons for indicating availability? [CC] icon?
 * UI for enabling multiple tracks?
 * <track> Chapters ‒ should the end point be significant?
 * Transcript ‒ can it be built into browsers in a sane way?
 * Descriptions ‒ synthesis?
 * WebVTT in WebM

Discussion topics:
 * search
 * chaptering and subchaptering, also useful for metadata-based access
 * url link to chapter
 * thumbnails are great for navigation
 * audio descriptions delivered as text descriptions
 * concerns of desktop players
   * why was a new format introduced?
     * need to support not just subtitles & captions, but also chapters, metadata & descriptions
     * better to have a separate file to the video to support many video formats
   * ...
 * simplicity to translate between new format and e.g. SRT
 * current state of <track> element
 * multitrack API: @mediagroup
 * run scripts at certain time: @kind=metadata track
 * security considerations: CORS & same-origin; no cross-origin xml file like Flash?
 * events are great
 * voice tag: how to expose special styling? apply class to <v> tag
 * Why not leveraging what is already available (e.g. matroska external entity support and ASS subtitle format)
