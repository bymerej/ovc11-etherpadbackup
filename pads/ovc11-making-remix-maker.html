<body>Objectives<br
/><br
/>1) An HTML5 version of the gendered ads Audio/Video Swapper<br
/>-ideally, this tool should allow people to download their remixes and post them elsewhere online.<br
/>-we'd like to get the code onto github<br
/><br
/>2) A github-like forking platform that lets end users access and build future variations of the Audio/Video swapper and other remixer applications (we mentioned datacouch.com)&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>3) A new variation of the Audio/Video Swapper that lets people swap the intro songs between television shows.<br
/><br
/>4) Getting started on building entirely new video remixer applications. Here's the potential projects that came up so far:<br
/>- Removing the voiceover track from movie trailers but keeping the music (with fletcher munsen curves? We would need someone who knows sound.)<br
/>- Rewriting the titles for advertisements or the subtitles for movies by using an interface that lets you just type them in (example: type your own Hitler Downfall Parody)<br
/>- Sculpting alternate versions of people's speeches by clicking through a menu that lets you mishmash their sentences (see "Rumsfeld Rules <a href="http://bit.ly/mYXQtl)">http://bit.ly/mYXQtl)</a><br
/>- A "VJ-O-Matic" tool that uses prematched beats and melodies to let people easily drag-and-drop a VJ mix (We would need a musician VJ or DJ to help us pick the tracks)<br
/>- An automatic lip-syncer that collects every possible syllable-shape that a mouth can make so you can lipsync anything you want&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp; (see some of the "read my lips" videos <a href="http://bit.ly/qK9z68">http://bit.ly/qK9z68</a> -- we would have to do research on the different syllable formations)<br
/><br
/><br
/><br
/>Session Prpoper:<br
/><br
/>- Projects that could do something with video gameplay footage?<br
/>- Education<br
/>- Cultural<br
